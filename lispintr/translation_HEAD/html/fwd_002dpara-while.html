<span id="The-forward-motion-while-loop"></span><h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The forward motion <code>while</code> loop</h4>

<p>The second part of the body of the <code>let*</code> deals with forward motion.
It is a <code>while</code> loop that repeats itself so long as the value of
<code>arg</code> is greater than zero.  In the most common use of the function,
the value of the argument is 1, so the body of the <code>while</code> loop is
evaluated exactly once, and the cursor moves forward one paragraph.
</p>

<p>This part handles three situations: when point is between paragraphs, when
there is a fill prefix and when there is no fill prefix.
</p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">going forwards and not at the end of the buffer</span>
(while (and (&gt; arg 0) (not (eobp)))

  ;; <span class="roman">between paragraphs</span>
  ;; Move forward over separator lines...
  (while (and (not (eobp))
              (progn (move-to-left-margin) (not (eobp)))
              (looking-at parsep))
    (forward-line 1))
  ;;  <span class="roman">This decrements the loop</span>
  (unless (eobp) (setq arg (1- arg)))
  ;; ... and one more line.
  (forward-line 1)
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">  (if fill-prefix-regexp
      ;; There is a fill prefix; it overrides parstart;
      ;; we go forward line by line
      (while (and (not (eobp))
                  (progn (move-to-left-margin) (not (eobp)))
                  (not (looking-at parsep))
                  (looking-at fill-prefix-regexp))
        (forward-line 1))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">    ;; There is no fill prefix;
    ;; we go forward character by character
    (while (and (re-search-forward sp-parstart nil 1)
                (progn (setq start (match-beginning 0))
                       (goto-char start)
                       (not (eobp)))
                (progn (move-to-left-margin)
                       (not (looking-at parsep)))
                (or (not (looking-at parstart))
                    (and use-hard-newlines
                         (not (get-text-property (1- start) 'hard)))))
      (forward-char 1))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">    ;; and if there is no fill prefix and if we are not at the end,
    ;;     go to whatever was found in the regular expression search
    ;;     for sp-parstart
    (if (&lt; (point) (point-max))
        (goto-char start))))
</pre></div>

<span id="index-eobp"></span>
<p>We can see that this is a decrementing counter <code>while</code> loop, using the
expression <code>(setq arg (1- arg))</code> as the decrementer.  That expression
is not far from the <code>while</code>, but is hidden in another Lisp macro, an
<code>unless</code> macro.  Unless we are at the end of the buffer&mdash;that is what
the <code>eobp</code> function determines; it is an abbreviation of &lsquo;<samp>End Of
Buffer P</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;we decrease the value of <code>arg</code> by one.
</p>
<p>(If we are at the end of the buffer, we cannot go forward any more and the
next loop of the <code>while</code> expression will test false since the test is
an <code>and</code> with <code>(not (eobp))</code>.  The <code>not</code> function means
exactly as you expect; it is another name for <code>null</code>, a function that
returns true when its argument is false.)
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the loop count is not decremented until we leave the space
between paragraphs, unless we come to the end of buffer or stop seeing the
local value of the paragraph separator.
</p>
<p>That second <code>while</code> also has a <code>(move-to-left-margin)</code>
expression.  The function is self-explanatory.  It is inside a <code>progn</code>
expression and not the last element of its body, so it is only invoked for
its side effect, which is to move point to the left margin of the current
line.
</p>
<span id="index-looking_002dat"></span>
<p>The <code>looking-at</code> function is also self-explanatory; it returns true if
the text after point matches the regular expression given as its argument.
</p>
<p>The rest of the body of the loop looks difficult at first, but makes sense
as you come to understand it.
</p>
<p>First consider what happens if there is a fill prefix:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  (if fill-prefix-regexp
      ;; There is a fill prefix; it overrides parstart;
      ;; we go forward line by line
      (while (and (not (eobp))
                  (progn (move-to-left-margin) (not (eobp)))
                  (not (looking-at parsep))
                  (looking-at fill-prefix-regexp))
        (forward-line 1))
</pre></div>

<p>This expression moves point forward line by line so long as four conditions
are true:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Point is not at the end of the buffer.

</li><li> We can move to the left margin of the text and are not at the end of the
buffer.

</li><li> The text following point does not separate paragraphs.

</li><li> The pattern following point is the fill prefix regular expression.
</li></ol>

<p>The last condition may be puzzling, until you remember that point was moved
to the beginning of the line early in the <code>forward-paragraph</code>
function.  This means that if the text has a fill prefix, the
<code>looking-at</code> function will see it.
</p>
<p>Consider what happens when there is no fill prefix.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    (while (and (re-search-forward sp-parstart nil 1)
                (progn (setq start (match-beginning 0))
                       (goto-char start)
                       (not (eobp)))
                (progn (move-to-left-margin)
                       (not (looking-at parsep)))
                (or (not (looking-at parstart))
                    (and use-hard-newlines
                         (not (get-text-property (1- start) 'hard)))))
      (forward-char 1))
</pre></div>

<p>This <code>while</code> loop has us searching forward for <code>sp-parstart</code>,
which is the combination of possible whitespace with the local value of the
start of a paragraph or of a paragraph separator.  (The latter two are
within an expression starting <code>\(?:</code> so that they are not referenced by
the <code>match-beginning</code> function.)
</p>
<p>The two expressions,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq start (match-beginning 0))
(goto-char start)
</pre></div>

<p>mean go to the start of the text matched by the regular expression search.
</p>
<p>The <code>(match-beginning 0)</code> expression is new.  It returns a number
specifying the location of the start of the text that was matched by the
last search.
</p>
<p>The <code>match-beginning</code> function is used here because of a characteristic
of a forward search: a successful forward search, regardless of whether it
is a plain search or a regular expression search, moves point to the end of
the text that is found.  In this case, a successful search moves point to
the end of the pattern for <code>sp-parstart</code>.
</p>
<p>However, we want to put point at the end of the current paragraph, not
somewhere else.  Indeed, since the search possibly includes the paragraph
separator, point may end up at the beginning of the next one unless we use
an expression that includes <code>match-beginning</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-match_002dbeginning"></span>
<p>When given an argument of 0, <code>match-beginning</code> returns the position
that is the start of the text matched by the most recent search.  In this
case, the most recent search looks for <code>sp-parstart</code>.  The
<code>(match-beginning 0)</code> expression returns the beginning position of that
pattern, rather than the end position of that pattern.
</p>
<p>(Incidentally, when passed a positive number as an argument, the
<code>match-beginning</code> function returns the location of point at that
parenthesized expression in the last search unless that parenthesized
expression begins with <code>\(?:</code>.  I don&rsquo;t know why <code>\(?:</code> appears
here since the argument is 0.)
</p>
<p>The last expression when there is no fill prefix is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(if (&lt; (point) (point-max))
    (goto-char start))))
</pre></div>

<p>This says that if there is no fill prefix and if we are not at the end,
point should move to the beginning of whatever was found by the regular
expression search for <code>sp-parstart</code>.
</p>
<p>The full definition for the <code>forward-paragraph</code> function not only
includes code for going forwards, but also code for going backwards.
</p>
<p>If you are reading this inside of GNU Emacs and you want to see the whole
function, you can type <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>)  and the name
of the function.  This gives you the function documentation and the name of
the library containing the function&rsquo;s source.  Place point over the name of
the library and press the <tt class="key">RET</tt> key; you will be taken directly to the
source.  (Be sure to install your sources! Without them, you are like a
person who tries to drive a car with his eyes shut!)
