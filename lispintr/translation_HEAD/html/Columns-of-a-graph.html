<span id="Printing-the-Columns-of-a-Graph"></span><h3 class="unnumberedsec">Printing the Columns of a Graph</h3>

<p>Since Emacs is designed to be flexible and work with all kinds of terminals,
including character-only terminals, the graph will need to be made from one
of the typewriter symbols.  An asterisk will do; as we enhance the
graph-printing function, we can make the choice of symbol a user option.
</p>
<p>We can call this function <code>graph-body-print</code>; it will take a
<code>numbers-list</code> as its only argument.  At this stage, we will not label
the graph, but only print its body.
</p>
<p>The <code>graph-body-print</code> function inserts a vertical column of asterisks
for each element in the <code>numbers-list</code>.  The height of each line is
determined by the value of that element of the <code>numbers-list</code>.
</p>
<p>Inserting columns is a repetitive act; that means that this function can be
written either with a <code>while</code> loop or recursively.
</p>
<p>Our first challenge is to discover how to print a column of asterisks.
Usually, in Emacs, we print characters onto a screen horizontally, line by
line, by typing.  We have two routes we can follow: write our own
column-insertion function or discover whether one exists in Emacs.
</p>
<p>To see whether there is one in Emacs, we can use the <kbd>M-x apropos</kbd>
command.  This command is like the <kbd>C-h a</kbd> (<code>command-apropos</code>)
command, except that the latter finds only those functions that are
commands.  The <kbd>M-x apropos</kbd> command lists all symbols that match a
regular expression, including functions that are not interactive.
<span id="index-apropos"></span>
</p>
<p>What we want to look for is some command that prints or inserts columns.
Very likely, the name of the function will contain either the word &ldquo;print&rdquo;
or the word &ldquo;insert&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;column&rdquo;.  Therefore, we can simply
type <kbd>M-x apropos <span class="key">RET</span> print\|insert\|column <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> and look at
the result.  On my system, this command once took quite some time, and then
produced a list of 79 functions and variables.  Now it does not take much
time at all and produces a list of 211 functions and variables.  Scanning
down the list, the only function that looks as if it might do the job is
<code>insert-rectangle</code>.
</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the function we want; its documentation says:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">insert-rectangle:
Insert text of RECTANGLE with upper left corner at point.
RECTANGLE's first line is inserted at point,
its second line is inserted at a point vertically under point, etc.
RECTANGLE should be a list of strings.
After this command, the mark is at the upper left corner
and point is at the lower right corner.
</pre></div>

<p>We can run a quick test, to make sure it does what we expect of it.
</p>
<p>Here is the result of placing the cursor after the <code>insert-rectangle</code>
expression and typing <kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>).  The
function inserts the strings &lsquo;<samp>&quot;first&quot;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>&quot;second&quot;</samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp>&quot;third&quot;</samp>&rsquo; at and below point.  Also the function returns <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(insert-rectangle '(&quot;first&quot; &quot;second&quot; &quot;third&quot;))first
                                              second
                                              thirdnil
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, we won&rsquo;t be inserting the text of the <code>insert-rectangle</code>
expression itself into the buffer in which we are making the graph, but will
call the function from our program.  We shall, however, have to make sure
that point is in the buffer at the place where the <code>insert-rectangle</code>
function will insert its column of strings.
</p>
<p>If you are reading this in Info, you can see how this works by switching to
another buffer, such as the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer, placing point somewhere
in the buffer, typing <kbd>M-:</kbd>, typing the <code>insert-rectangle</code>
expression into the minibuffer at the prompt, and then typing <tt class="key">RET</tt>.
This causes Emacs to evaluate the expression in the minibuffer, but to use
as the value of point the position of point in the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer.
(<kbd>M-:</kbd> is the keybinding for <code>eval-expression</code>. Also, <code>nil</code>
does not appear in the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer since the expression is
evaluated in the minibuffer.)
</p>
<p>We find when we do this that point ends up at the end of the last inserted
line&mdash;that is to say, this function moves point as a side-effect.  If we
were to repeat the command, with point at this position, the next insertion
would be below and to the right of the previous insertion.  We don&rsquo;t want
this! If we are going to make a bar graph, the columns need to be beside
each other.
</p>
<p>So we discover that each cycle of the column-inserting <code>while</code> loop
must reposition point to the place we want it, and that place will be at the
top, not the bottom, of the column.  Moreover, we remember that when we
print a graph, we do not expect all the columns to be the same height.  This
means that the top of each column may be at a different height from the
previous one.  We cannot simply reposition point to the same line each time,
but moved over to the right&mdash;or perhaps we can&hellip;
</p>
<p>We are planning to make the columns of the bar graph out of asterisks.  The
number of asterisks in the column is the number specified by the current
element of the <code>numbers-list</code>.  We need to construct a list of
asterisks of the right length for each call to <code>insert-rectangle</code>.  If
this list consists solely of the requisite number of asterisks, then we will
have to position point the right number of lines above the base for the
graph to print correctly.  This could be difficult.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we can figure out some way to pass <code>insert-rectangle</code>
a list of the same length each time, then we can place point on the same
line each time, but move it over one column to the right for each new
column.  If we do this, however, some of the entries in the list passed to
<code>insert-rectangle</code> must be blanks rather than asterisks.  For example,
if the maximum height of the graph is 5, but the height of the column is 3,
then <code>insert-rectangle</code> requires an argument that looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>This last proposal is not so difficult, so long as we can determine the
column height.  There are two ways for us to specify the column height: we
can arbitrarily state what it will be, which would work fine for graphs of
that height; or we can search through the list of numbers and use the
maximum height of the list as the maximum height of the graph.  If the
latter operation were difficult, then the former procedure would be easiest,
but there is a function built into Emacs that determines the maximum of its
arguments.  We can use that function.  The function is called <code>max</code> and
it returns the largest of all its arguments, which must be numbers.  Thus,
for example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(max  3 4 6 5 7 3)
</pre></div>

<p>returns 7.  (A corresponding function called <code>min</code> returns the smallest
of all its arguments.)
<span id="index-max"></span>
<span id="index-min"></span>
</p>
<p>However, we cannot simply call <code>max</code> on the <code>numbers-list</code>; the
<code>max</code> function expects numbers as its argument, not a list of numbers.
Thus, the following expression,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(max  '(3 4 6 5 7 3))
</pre></div>

<p>produces the following error message;
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Wrong type of argument:  number-or-marker-p, (3 4 6 5 7 3)
</pre></div>

<span id="index-apply"></span>
<p>We need a function that passes a list of arguments to a function.  This
function is <code>apply</code>.  This function applies its first argument (a
function) to its remaining arguments, the last of which may be a list.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(apply 'max 3 4 7 3 '(4 8 5))
</pre></div>

<p>returns 8.
</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I don&rsquo;t know how you would learn of this function without a
book such as this.  It is possible to discover other functions, like
<code>search-forward</code> or <code>insert-rectangle</code>, by guessing at a part of
their names and then using <code>apropos</code>.  Even though its base in metaphor
is clear&mdash;apply its first argument to the rest&mdash;I doubt a novice would
come up with that particular word when using <code>apropos</code> or other aid.
Of course, I could be wrong; after all, the function was first named by
someone who had to invent it.)
</p>
<p>The second and subsequent arguments to <code>apply</code> are optional, so we can
use <code>apply</code> to call a function and pass the elements of a list to it,
like this, which also returns 8:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(apply 'max '(4 8 5))
</pre></div>

<p>This latter way is how we will use <code>apply</code>.  The
<code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> function returns a numbers&rsquo; list to
which we can apply <code>max</code> (we could also apply <code>max</code> to the sorted
numbers&rsquo; list; it does not matter whether the list is sorted or not.)
</p>
<p>Hence, the operation for finding the maximum height of the graph is this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq max-graph-height (apply 'max numbers-list))
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can return to the question of how to create a list of strings for a
column of the graph.  Told the maximum height of the graph and the number of
asterisks that should appear in the column, the function should return a
list of strings for the <code>insert-rectangle</code> command to insert.
</p>
<p>Each column is made up of asterisks or blanks.  Since the function is passed
the value of the height of the column and the number of asterisks in the
column, the number of blanks can be found by subtracting the number of
asterisks from the height of the column.  Given the number of blanks and the
number of asterisks, two <code>while</code> loops can be used to construct the
list:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">First version.</span>
(defun column-of-graph (max-graph-height actual-height)
  &quot;Return list of strings that is one column of a graph.&quot;
  (let ((insert-list nil)
        (number-of-top-blanks
         (- max-graph-height actual-height)))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">    ;; <span class="roman">Fill in asterisks.</span>
    (while (&gt; actual-height 0)
      (setq insert-list (cons &quot;*&quot; insert-list))
      (setq actual-height (1- actual-height)))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">    ;; <span class="roman">Fill in blanks.</span>
    (while (&gt; number-of-top-blanks 0)
      (setq insert-list (cons &quot; &quot; insert-list))
      (setq number-of-top-blanks
            (1- number-of-top-blanks)))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">    ;; <span class="roman">Return whole list.</span>
    insert-list))
</pre></div>

<p>If you install this function and then evaluate the following expression you
will see that it returns the list as desired:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(column-of-graph 5 3)
</pre></div>

<p>returns
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>As written, <code>column-of-graph</code> contains a major flaw: the symbols used
for the blank and for the marked entries in the column are hard-coded as a
space and asterisk.  This is fine for a prototype, but you, or another user,
may wish to use other symbols.  For example, in testing the graph function,
you may want to use a period in place of the space, to make sure the point
is being repositioned properly each time the <code>insert-rectangle</code>
function is called; or you might want to substitute a &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; sign or other
symbol for the asterisk.  You might even want to make a graph-column that is
more than one display column wide.  The program should be more flexible.
The way to do that is to replace the blank and the asterisk with two
variables that we can call <code>graph-blank</code> and <code>graph-symbol</code> and
define those variables separately.
</p>
<p>Also, the documentation is not well written.  These considerations lead us
to the second version of the function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defvar graph-symbol &quot;*&quot;
  &quot;String used as symbol in graph, usually an asterisk.&quot;)
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">(defvar graph-blank &quot; &quot;
  &quot;String used as blank in graph, usually a blank space.
graph-blank must be the same number of columns wide
as graph-symbol.&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>(For an explanation of <code>defvar</code>, see <a href="defvar.html">Initializing a
Variable with <code>defvar</code></a>.)
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">Second version.</span>
(defun column-of-graph (max-graph-height actual-height)
  &quot;Return MAX-GRAPH-HEIGHT strings; ACTUAL-HEIGHT are graph-symbols.

</pre><pre class="example">The graph-symbols are contiguous entries at the end
of the list.
The list will be inserted as one column of a graph.
The strings are either graph-blank or graph-symbol.&quot;
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">  (let ((insert-list nil)
        (number-of-top-blanks
         (- max-graph-height actual-height)))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">    ;; <span class="roman">Fill in <code>graph-symbols</code>.</span>
    (while (&gt; actual-height 0)
      (setq insert-list (cons graph-symbol insert-list))
      (setq actual-height (1- actual-height)))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">    ;; <span class="roman">Fill in <code>graph-blanks</code>.</span>
    (while (&gt; number-of-top-blanks 0)
      (setq insert-list (cons graph-blank insert-list))
      (setq number-of-top-blanks
            (1- number-of-top-blanks)))

    ;; <span class="roman">Return whole list.</span>
    insert-list))
</pre></div>

<p>If we wished, we could rewrite <code>column-of-graph</code> a third time to
provide optionally for a line graph as well as for a bar graph.  This would
not be hard to do.  One way to think of a line graph is that it is no more
than a bar graph in which the part of each bar that is below the top is
blank.  To construct a column for a line graph, the function first
constructs a list of blanks that is one shorter than the value, then it uses
<code>cons</code> to attach a graph symbol to the list; then it uses <code>cons</code>
again to attach the top blanks to the list.
</p>
<p>It is easy to see how to write such a function, but since we don&rsquo;t need it,
we will not do it.  But the job could be done, and if it were done, it would
be done with <code>column-of-graph</code>.  Even more important, it is worth
noting that few changes would have to be made anywhere else.  The
enhancement, if we ever wish to make it, is simple.
</p>
<p>Now, finally, we come to our first actual graph printing function.  This
prints the body of a graph, not the labels for the vertical and horizontal
axes, so we can call this <code>graph-body-print</code>.
