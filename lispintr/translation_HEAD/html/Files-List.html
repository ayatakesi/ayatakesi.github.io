<span id="Making-a-List-of-Files"></span><h4 class="subsection">14.9.2 Making a List of Files</h4>

<p>The <code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> function requires a list of
files as its argument.  For our test examples, we constructed such a list by
hand; but the Emacs Lisp source directory is too large for us to do for
that.  Instead, we will write a function to do the job for us.  In this
function, we will use both a <code>while</code> loop and a recursive call.
</p>
<span id="index-directory_002dfiles"></span>
<p>We did not have to write a function like this for older versions of GNU
Emacs, since they placed all the &lsquo;<samp>.el</samp>&rsquo; files in one directory.
Instead, we were able to use the <code>directory-files</code> function, which
lists the names of files that match a specified pattern within a single
directory.
</p>
<p>However, recent versions of Emacs place Emacs Lisp files in sub-directories
of the top level <samp>lisp</samp> directory.  This re-arrangement eases
navigation.  For example, all the mail related files are in a <samp>lisp</samp>
sub-directory called <samp>mail</samp>.  But at the same time, this arrangement
forces us to create a file listing function that descends into the
sub-directories.
</p>
<span id="index-files_002din_002dbelow_002ddirectory"></span>
<p>We can create this function, called <code>files-in-below-directory</code>, using
familiar functions such as <code>car</code>, <code>nthcdr</code>, and <code>substring</code>
in conjunction with an existing function called
<code>directory-files-and-attributes</code>.  This latter function not only lists
all the filenames in a directory, including the names of sub-directories,
but also their attributes.
</p>
<p>To restate our goal: to create a function that will enable us to feed
filenames to <code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> as a list that looks
like this (but with more elements):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(&quot;./lisp/macros.el&quot;
 &quot;./lisp/mail/rmail.el&quot;
 &quot;./lisp/makesum.el&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>directory-files-and-attributes</code> function returns a list of lists.
Each of the lists within the main list consists of 13 elements.  The first
element is a string that contains the name of the file&mdash;which, in
GNU/Linux, may be a <em>directory file</em>, that is to say, a file with the
special attributes of a directory.  The second element of the list is
<code>t</code> for a directory, a string for symbolic link (the string is the name
linked to), or <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, the first &lsquo;<samp>.el</samp>&rsquo; file in the <samp>lisp/</samp> directory is
<samp>abbrev.el</samp>.  Its name is
<samp>/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/abbrev.el</samp> and it is not a
directory or a symbolic link.
</p>
<p>This is how <code>directory-files-and-attributes</code> lists that file and its
attributes:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(&quot;abbrev.el&quot;
nil
1
1000
100
</pre><pre class="example">(20615 27034 579989 697000)
(17905 55681 0 0)
(20615 26327 734791 805000)
13188
&quot;-rw-r--r--&quot;
</pre><pre class="example">t
2971624
773)
</pre></div>

<p>On the other hand, <samp>mail/</samp> is a directory within the <samp>lisp/</samp>
directory.  The beginning of its listing looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(&quot;mail&quot;
t
&hellip;
)
</pre></div>

<p>(To learn about the different attributes, look at the documentation of
<code>file-attributes</code>.  Bear in mind that the <code>file-attributes</code>
function does not list the filename, so its first element is
<code>directory-files-and-attributes</code>&rsquo;s second element.)
</p>
<p>We will want our new function, <code>files-in-below-directory</code>, to list the
&lsquo;<samp>.el</samp>&rsquo; files in the directory it is told to check, and in any
directories below that directory.
</p>
<p>This gives us a hint on how to construct <code>files-in-below-directory</code>:
within a directory, the function should add &lsquo;<samp>.el</samp>&rsquo; filenames to a list;
and if, within a directory, the function comes upon a sub-directory, it
should go into that sub-directory and repeat its actions.
</p>
<p>However, we should note that every directory contains a name that refers to
itself, called <samp>.</samp> (&ldquo;dot&rdquo;), and a name that refers to its parent
directory, called <samp>..</samp> (&ldquo;dot dot&rdquo;).  (In <samp>/</samp>, the root
directory, <samp>..</samp> refers to itself, since <samp>/</samp> has no parent.)
Clearly, we do not want our <code>files-in-below-directory</code> function to
enter those directories, since they always lead us, directly or indirectly,
to the current directory.
</p>
<p>Consequently, our <code>files-in-below-directory</code> function must do several
tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Check to see whether it is looking at a filename that ends in &lsquo;<samp>.el</samp>&rsquo;;
and if so, add its name to a list.

</li><li> Check to see whether it is looking at a filename that is the name of a
directory; and if so,

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- Check to see whether it is looking at <samp>.</samp> or <samp>..</samp>; and if so skip
it.

</li><li>- Or else, go into that directory and repeat the process.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s write a function definition to do these tasks.  We will use a
<code>while</code> loop to move from one filename to another within a directory,
checking what needs to be done; and we will use a recursive call to repeat
the actions on each sub-directory.  The recursive pattern is Accumulate
(see <a href="Accumulate.html">Recursive Pattern: <em>accumulate</em></a>), using <code>append</code> as the combiner.
</p>


<p>Here is the function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun files-in-below-directory (directory)
  &quot;List the .el files in DIRECTORY and in its sub-directories.&quot;
  ;; Although the function will be used non-interactively,
  ;; it will be easier to test if we make it interactive.
  ;; The directory will have a name such as
  ;;  &quot;/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/&quot;
  (interactive &quot;DDirectory name: &quot;)
</pre><pre class="example">  (let (el-files-list
        (current-directory-list
         (directory-files-and-attributes directory t)))
    ;; while we are in the current directory
    (while current-directory-list
</pre><pre class="example">      (cond
       ;; check to see whether filename ends in '.el'
       ;; and if so, add its name to a list.
       ((equal &quot;.el&quot; (substring (car (car current-directory-list)) -3))
        (setq el-files-list
              (cons (car (car current-directory-list)) el-files-list)))
</pre><pre class="example">       ;; check whether filename is that of a directory
       ((eq t (car (cdr (car current-directory-list))))
        ;; decide whether to skip or recurse
        (if
            (equal &quot;.&quot;
                   (substring (car (car current-directory-list)) -1))
            ;; then do nothing since filename is that of
            ;;   current directory or parent, &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot;
            ()
</pre><pre class="example">          ;; else descend into the directory and repeat the process
          (setq el-files-list
                (append
                 (files-in-below-directory
                  (car (car current-directory-list)))
                 el-files-list)))))
      ;; move to the next filename in the list; this also
      ;; shortens the list so the while loop eventually comes to an end
      (setq current-directory-list (cdr current-directory-list)))
    ;; return the filenames
    el-files-list))
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>files-in-below-directory</code> <code>directory-files</code> function takes
one argument, the name of a directory.
</p>
<p>Thus, on my system,
</p>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(length
 (files-in-below-directory &quot;/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/&quot;))
</pre></div>

<p>tells me that in and below my Lisp sources directory are 1031 &lsquo;<samp>.el</samp>&rsquo;
files.
</p>
<p><code>files-in-below-directory</code> returns a list in reverse alphabetical
order.  An expression to sort the list in alphabetical order looks like
this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(sort
 (files-in-below-directory &quot;/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/&quot;)
 'string-lessp)
</pre></div>
