<span id="Some-Keybindings"></span><h3 class="section">16.7 Some Keybindings</h3>

<p>Now for some personal keybindings:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; Compare windows
(global-set-key &quot;\C-cw&quot; 'compare-windows)
</pre></div>

<span id="index-compare_002dwindows"></span>
<p><code>compare-windows</code> is a nifty command that compares the text in your
current window with text in the next window.  It makes the comparison by
starting at point in each window, moving over text in each window as far as
they match.  I use this command all the time.
</p>
<p>This also shows how to set a key globally, for all modes.
</p>
<span id="index-Setting-a-key-globally"></span>
<span id="index-Global-set-key"></span>
<span id="index-Key-setting-globally"></span>
<span id="index-global_002dset_002dkey"></span>
<p>The command is <code>global-set-key</code>.  It is followed by the keybinding.  In
a <samp>.emacs</samp> file, the keybinding is written as shown: <code>\C-c</code> stands
for Control-C, which means to press the control key and the <kbd>c</kbd> key at
the same time.  The <code>w</code> means to press the <kbd>w</kbd> key.  The keybinding
is surrounded by double quotation marks.  In documentation, you would write
this as <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-c</span>&nbsp;w</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  (If you were binding a <tt class="key">META</tt> key, such as
<kbd>M-c</kbd>, rather than a <tt class="key">CTRL</tt> key, you would write <code><span class="nolinebreak">\M-c</span></code><!-- /@w --> in
your <samp>.emacs</samp> file.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Rebinding.html#Init-Rebinding">Rebinding Keys in Your
Init File</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, for details.)
</p>
<p>The command invoked by the keys is <code>compare-windows</code>.  Note that
<code>compare-windows</code> is preceded by a single-quote; otherwise, Emacs would
first try to evaluate the symbol to determine its value.
</p>
<p>These three things, the double quotation marks, the backslash before the
&lsquo;<samp>C</samp>&rsquo;, and the single-quote are necessary parts of keybinding that I tend
to forget.  Fortunately, I have come to remember that I should look at my
existing <samp>.emacs</samp> file, and adapt what is there.
</p>
<p>As for the keybinding itself: <kbd>C-c w</kbd>.  This combines the prefix key,
<kbd>C-c</kbd>, with a single character, in this case, <kbd>w</kbd>.  This set of
keys, <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by a single character, is strictly reserved for
individuals&rsquo; own use.  (I call these <em>own</em> keys, since these are for my
own use.)  You should always be able to create such a keybinding for your
own use without stomping on someone else&rsquo;s keybinding.  If you ever write an
extension to Emacs, please avoid taking any of these keys for public use.
Create a key like <kbd>C-c C-w</kbd> instead.  Otherwise, we will run out of own
keys.
</p>
<p>Here is another keybinding, with a comment:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; Keybinding for 'occur'
; I use occur a lot, so let's bind it to a key:
(global-set-key &quot;\C-co&quot; 'occur)
</pre></div>

<span id="index-occur"></span>
<p>The <code>occur</code> command shows all the lines in the current buffer that
contain a match for a regular expression.  When the region is active,
<code>occur</code> restricts matches to such region.  Otherwise it uses the entire
buffer.  Matching lines are shown in a buffer called <samp>*Occur*</samp>.  That
buffer serves as a menu to jump to occurrences.
</p>
<span id="index-global_002dunset_002dkey"></span>
<span id="index-Unbinding-key"></span>
<span id="index-Key-unbinding"></span>
<p>Here is how to unbind a key, so it does not work:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; Unbind 'C-x f'
(global-unset-key &quot;\C-xf&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>There is a reason for this unbinding: I found I inadvertently typed
<kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;f</kbd><!-- /@w --> when I meant to type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.  Rather than find a
file, as I intended, I accidentally set the width for filled text, almost
always to a width I did not want.  Since I hardly ever reset my default
width, I simply unbound the key.
</p>
<span id="index-list_002dbuffers_002c-rebound"></span>
<span id="index-buffer_002dmenu_002c-bound-to-key"></span>
<p>The following rebinds an existing key:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; Rebind 'C-x C-b' for 'buffer-menu'
(global-set-key &quot;\C-x\C-b&quot; 'buffer-menu)
</pre></div>

<p>By default, <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> runs the <code>list-buffers</code> command.  This
command lists your buffers in <em>another</em> window.  Since I almost always
want to do something in that window, I prefer the <code>buffer-menu</code>
command, which not only lists the buffers, but moves point into that window.
