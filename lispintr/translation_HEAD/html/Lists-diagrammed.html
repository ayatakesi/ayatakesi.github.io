<p>For example, the list <code>(rose violet buttercup)</code> has three elements,
&lsquo;<samp>rose</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>violet</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>buttercup</samp>&rsquo;.  In the computer, the
electronic address of &lsquo;<samp>rose</samp>&rsquo; is recorded in a segment of computer
memory along with the address that gives the electronic address of where the
atom &lsquo;<samp>violet</samp>&rsquo; is located; and that address (the one that tells where
&lsquo;<samp>violet</samp>&rsquo; is located) is kept along with an address that tells where the
address for the atom &lsquo;<samp>buttercup</samp>&rsquo; is located.
</p>
<p>This sounds more complicated than it is and is easier seen in a diagram:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    ___ ___      ___ ___      ___ ___
   |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
     |            |            |
     |            |            |
      --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>

<p>In the diagram, each box represents a word of computer memory that holds a
Lisp object, usually in the form of a memory address.  The boxes, i.e., the
addresses, are in pairs.  Each arrow points to what the address is the
address of, either an atom or another pair of addresses.  The first box is
the electronic address of &lsquo;<samp>rose</samp>&rsquo; and the arrow points to &lsquo;<samp>rose</samp>&rsquo;;
the second box is the address of the next pair of boxes, the first part of
which is the address of &lsquo;<samp>violet</samp>&rsquo; and the second part of which is the
address of the next pair.  The very last box points to the symbol
<code>nil</code>, which marks the end of the list.
</p>
<p>When a variable is set to a list with an operation such as <code>setq</code>, it
stores the address of the first box in the variable.  Thus, evaluation of
the expression
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq bouquet '(rose violet buttercup))
</pre></div>

<p>creates a situation like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">bouquet
     |
     |     ___ ___      ___ ___      ___ ___
      --&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
            |            |            |
            |            |            |
             --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>

<p>In this example, the symbol <code>bouquet</code> holds the address of the first
pair of boxes.
</p>
<p>This same list can be illustrated in a different sort of box notation like
this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">bouquet
 |
 |    --------------       ---------------       ----------------
 |   | car   | cdr  |     | car    | cdr  |     | car     | cdr  |
  --&gt;| rose  |   o-------&gt;| violet |   o-------&gt;| butter- |  nil |
     |       |      |     |        |      |     | cup     |      |
      --------------       ---------------       ----------------
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>

<p>(Symbols consist of more than pairs of addresses, but the structure of a
symbol is made up of addresses.  Indeed, the symbol <code>bouquet</code> consists
of a group of address-boxes, one of which is the address of the printed word
&lsquo;<samp>bouquet</samp>&rsquo;, a second of which is the address of a function definition
attached to the symbol, if any, a third of which is the address of the first
pair of address-boxes for the list <code>(rose violet buttercup)</code>, and so
on.  Here we are showing that the symbol&rsquo;s third address-box points to the
first pair of address-boxes for the list.)
</p>
<p>If a symbol is set to the <small>CDR</small> of a list, the list itself is not
changed; the symbol simply has an address further down the list.  (In the
jargon, <small>CAR</small> and <small>CDR</small> are &ldquo;non-destructive&rdquo;.)  Thus, evaluation of
the following expression
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq flowers (cdr bouquet))
</pre></div>

<p>produces this:
</p>
<br>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">bouquet        flowers
  |              |
  |     ___ ___  |     ___ ___      ___ ___
   --&gt; |   |   |  --&gt; |   |   |    |   |   |
       |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
         |              |            |
         |              |            |
          --&gt; rose       --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The value of <code>flowers</code> is <code>(violet buttercup)</code>, which is to say,
the symbol <code>flowers</code> holds the address of the pair of address-boxes,
the first of which holds the address of <code>violet</code>, and the second of
which holds the address of <code>buttercup</code>.
</p>
<p>A pair of address-boxes is called a <em>cons cell</em> or <em>dotted pair</em>.
See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Cons-Cell-Type.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell and List Types</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</cite>, and <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dotted-Pair-Notation.html#Dotted-Pair-Notation">Dotted Pair Notation</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, for more information about cons
cells and dotted pairs.
</p>
<p>The function <code>cons</code> adds a new pair of addresses to the front of a
series of addresses like that shown above.  For example, evaluating the
expression
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq bouquet (cons 'lily bouquet))
</pre></div>

<p>produces:
</p>
<br>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">bouquet                       flowers
  |                             |
  |     ___ ___        ___ ___  |     ___ ___       ___ ___
   --&gt; |   |   |      |   |   |  --&gt; |   |   |     |   |   |
       |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|----&gt;|___|___|--&gt; nil
         |              |              |             |
         |              |              |             |
          --&gt; lily      --&gt; rose       --&gt; violet    --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>However, this does not change the value of the symbol <code>flowers</code>, as you
can see by evaluating the following,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(eq (cdr (cdr bouquet)) flowers)
</pre></div>

<p>which returns <code>t</code> for true.
</p>
<p>Until it is reset, <code>flowers</code> still has the value <code>(violet
buttercup)</code>; that is, it has the address of the cons cell whose first
address is of <code>violet</code>.  Also, this does not alter any of the
pre-existing cons cells; they are all still there.
</p>
<p>Thus, in Lisp, to get the <small>CDR</small> of a list, you just get the address of
the next cons cell in the series; to get the <small>CAR</small> of a list, you get the
address of the first element of the list; to <code>cons</code> a new element on a
list, you add a new cons cell to the front of the list.  That is all there
is to it! The underlying structure of Lisp is brilliantly simple!
</p>
<p>And what does the last address in a series of cons cells refer to? It is the
address of the empty list, of <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p>In summary, when a Lisp variable is set to a value, it is provided with the
address of the list to which the variable refers.
