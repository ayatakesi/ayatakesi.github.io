<span id="Lisp-Atoms-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 Lisp Atoms</h4>
<span id="index-Lisp-Atoms"></span>

<p>In Lisp, what we have been calling words are called <em>atoms</em>.  This term
comes from the historical meaning of the word atom, which means
&ldquo;indivisible&rdquo;.  As far as Lisp is concerned, the words we have been using
in the lists cannot be divided into any smaller parts and still mean the
same thing as part of a program; likewise with numbers and single character
symbols like &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;.  On the other hand, unlike an ancient atom, a list
can be split into parts.  (See <a href="car-cdr-_0026-cons.html"><code>car</code> <code>cdr</code> &amp;
<code>cons</code> Fundamental Functions</a>.)
</p>
<p>In a list, atoms are separated from each other by whitespace.  They can be
right next to a parenthesis.
</p>
<span id="index-empty-list-defined"></span>
<p>Technically speaking, a list in Lisp consists of parentheses surrounding
atoms separated by whitespace or surrounding other lists or surrounding both
atoms and other lists.  A list can have just one atom in it or have nothing
in it at all.  A list with nothing in it looks like this: <code>()</code>, and is
called the <em>empty list</em>.  Unlike anything else, an empty list is
considered both an atom and a list at the same time.
</p>
<span id="index-Symbolic-expressions_002c-introduced"></span>
<span id="index-expression-defined"></span>
<span id="index-form-defined"></span>
<p>The printed representation of both atoms and lists are called <em>symbolic
expressions</em> or, more concisely, <em>s-expressions</em>.  The word
<em>expression</em> by itself can refer to either the printed representation,
or to the atom or list as it is held internally in the computer.  Often,
people use the term <em>expression</em> indiscriminately.  (Also, in many
texts, the word <em>form</em> is used as a synonym for expression.)
</p>
<p>Incidentally, the atoms that make up our universe were named such when they
were thought to be indivisible; but it has been found that physical atoms
are not indivisible.  Parts can split off an atom or it can fission into two
parts of roughly equal size.  Physical atoms were named prematurely, before
their truer nature was found.  In Lisp, certain kinds of atom, such as an
array, can be separated into parts; but the mechanism for doing this is
different from the mechanism for splitting a list.  As far as list
operations are concerned, the atoms of a list are unsplittable.
</p>
<p>As in English, the meanings of the component letters of a Lisp atom are
different from the meaning the letters make as a word.  For example, the
word for the South American sloth, the &lsquo;<samp>ai</samp>&rsquo;, is completely different
from the two words, &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>i</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>There are many kinds of atom in nature but only a few in Lisp: for example,
<em>numbers</em>, such as 37, 511, or 1729, and <em>symbols</em>, such as
&lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>forward-line</samp>&rsquo;.  The words we have listed in
the examples above are all symbols.  In everyday Lisp conversation, the word
&ldquo;atom&rdquo; is not often used, because programmers usually try to be more
specific about what kind of atom they are dealing with.  Lisp programming is
mostly about symbols (and sometimes numbers)  within lists.  (Incidentally,
the preceding three word parenthetical remark is a proper list in Lisp,
since it consists of atoms, which in this case are symbols, separated by
whitespace and enclosed by parentheses, without any non-Lisp punctuation.)
</p>
<p>Text between double quotation marks&mdash;even sentences or paragraphs&mdash;is also
an atom.  Here is an example:
<span id="index-Text-between-double-quotation-marks"></span>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">'(this list includes &quot;text between quotation marks.&quot;)
</pre></div>

<span id="index-string-defined"></span>
<p>In Lisp, all of the quoted text including the punctuation mark and the blank
spaces is a single atom.  This kind of atom is called a <em>string</em> (for
&ldquo;string of characters&rdquo;) and is the sort of thing that is used for messages
that a computer can print for a human to read.  Strings are a different kind
of atom than numbers or symbols and are used differently.
