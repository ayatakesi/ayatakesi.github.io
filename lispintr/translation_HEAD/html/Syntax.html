<span id="What-Constitutes-a-Word-or-Symbol_003f"></span><h3 class="section">14.2 What Constitutes a Word or Symbol?</h3>
<span id="index-Syntax-categories-and-tables"></span>

<p>Emacs treats different characters as belonging to different <em>syntax
categories</em>.  For example, the regular expression, &lsquo;<samp>\\w+</samp>&rsquo;, is a pattern
specifying one or more <em>word constituent</em> characters.  Word constituent
characters are members of one syntax category.  Other syntax categories
include the class of punctuation characters, such as the period and the
comma, and the class of whitespace characters, such as the blank space and
the tab character.  (For more information, see <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax
Tables</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.)
</p>
<p>Syntax tables specify which characters belong to which categories.  Usually,
a hyphen is not specified as a word constituent character.  Instead, it is
specified as being in the class of characters that are part of symbol names
but not words.  This means that the <code>count-words-example</code> function
treats it in the same way it treats an interword white space, which is why
<code>count-words-example</code> counts &lsquo;<samp>multiply-by-seven</samp>&rsquo; as three words.
</p>
<p>There are two ways to cause Emacs to count &lsquo;<samp>multiply-by-seven</samp>&rsquo; as one
symbol: modify the syntax table or modify the regular expression.
</p>
<p>We could redefine a hyphen as a word constituent character by modifying the
syntax table that Emacs keeps for each mode.  This action would serve our
purpose, except that a hyphen is merely the most common character within
symbols that is not typically a word constituent character; there are
others, too.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can redefine the regexp used in the
<code>count-words-example</code> definition so as to include symbols.  This
procedure has the merit of clarity, but the task is a little tricky.
</p>
<p>The first part is simple enough: the pattern must match at least one
character that is a word or symbol constituent.  Thus:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&quot;\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>\\(</samp>&rsquo; is the first part of the grouping construct that includes the
&lsquo;<samp>\\w</samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp>\\s_</samp>&rsquo; as alternatives, separated by the
&lsquo;<samp>\\|</samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp>\\w</samp>&rsquo; matches any word-constituent character and the
&lsquo;<samp>\\s_</samp>&rsquo; matches any character that is part of a symbol name but not a
word-constituent character.  The &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; following the group indicates that
the word or symbol constituent characters must be matched at least once.
</p>
<p>However, the second part of the regexp is more difficult to design.  What we
want is to follow the first part with optionally one or more characters that
are not constituents of a word or symbol.  At first, I thought I could
define this with the following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&quot;\\(\\W\\|\\S_\\)*&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The upper case &lsquo;<samp>W</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>S</samp>&rsquo; match characters that are <em>not</em>
word or symbol constituents.  Unfortunately, this expression matches any
character that is either not a word constituent or not a symbol
constituent.  This matches any character!
</p>
<p>I then noticed that every word or symbol in my test region was followed by
white space (blank space, tab, or newline).  So I tried placing a pattern to
match one or more blank spaces after the pattern for one or more word or
symbol constituents.  This failed, too.  Words and symbols are often
separated by whitespace, but in actual code parentheses may follow symbols
and punctuation may follow words.  So finally, I designed a pattern in which
the word or symbol constituents are followed optionally by characters that
are not white space and then followed optionally by white space.
</p>
<p>Here is the full regular expression:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&quot;\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+[^ \t\n]*[ \t\n]*&quot;
</pre></div>
