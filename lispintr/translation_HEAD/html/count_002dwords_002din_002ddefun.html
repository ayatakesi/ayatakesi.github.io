<span id="The-count_002dwords_002din_002ddefun-Function"></span><h3 class="section">14.3 The <code>count-words-in-defun</code> Function</h3>
<span id="index-Counting-words-in-a-defun-1"></span>

<p>We have seen that there are several ways to write a
<code>count-words-region</code> function.  To write a <code>count-words-in-defun</code>,
we need merely adapt one of these versions.
</p>
<p>The version that uses a <code>while</code> loop is easy to understand, so I am
going to adapt that.  Because <code>count-words-in-defun</code> will be part of a
more complex program, it need not be interactive and it need not display a
message but just return the count.  These considerations simplify the
definition a little.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, <code>count-words-in-defun</code> will be used within a buffer
that contains function definitions.  Consequently, it is reasonable to ask
that the function determine whether it is called when point is within a
function definition, and if it is, to return the count for that definition.
This adds complexity to the definition, but saves us from needing to pass
arguments to the function.
</p>
<p>These considerations lead us to prepare the following template:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun count-words-in-defun ()
  &quot;<var>documentation</var>&hellip;&quot;
  (<var>set up</var>&hellip;
     (<var>while loop</var>&hellip;)
   <var>return count</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>As usual, our job is to fill in the slots.
</p>
<p>First, the set up.
</p>
<p>We are presuming that this function will be called within a buffer
containing function definitions.  Point will either be within a function
definition or not.  For <code>count-words-in-defun</code> to work, point must move
to the beginning of the definition, a counter must start at zero, and the
counting loop must stop when point reaches the end of the definition.
</p>
<p>The <code>beginning-of-defun</code> function searches backwards for an opening
delimiter such as a &lsquo;<samp>(</samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of a line, and moves point to
that position, or else to the limit of the search.  In practice, this means
that <code>beginning-of-defun</code> moves point to the beginning of an enclosing
or preceding function definition, or else to the beginning of the buffer.
We can use <code>beginning-of-defun</code> to place point where we wish to start.
</p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop requires a counter to keep track of the words or
symbols being counted.  A <code>let</code> expression can be used to create a
local variable for this purpose, and bind it to an initial value of zero.
</p>
<p>The <code>end-of-defun</code> function works like <code>beginning-of-defun</code> except
that it moves point to the end of the definition.  <code>end-of-defun</code> can
be used as part of an expression that determines the position of the end of
the definition.
</p>
<p>The set up for <code>count-words-in-defun</code> takes shape rapidly: first we
move point to the beginning of the definition, then we create a local
variable to hold the count, and finally, we record the position of the end
of the definition so the <code>while</code> loop will know when to stop looping.
</p>
<p>The code looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(beginning-of-defun)
(let ((count 0)
      (end (save-excursion (end-of-defun) (point))))
</pre></div>

<p>The code is simple.  The only slight complication is likely to concern
<code>end</code>: it is bound to the position of the end of the definition by a
<code>save-excursion</code> expression that returns the value of point after
<code>end-of-defun</code> temporarily moves it to the end of the definition.
</p>
<p>The second part of the <code>count-words-in-defun</code>, after the set up, is the
<code>while</code> loop.
</p>
<p>The loop must contain an expression that jumps point forward word by word
and symbol by symbol, and another expression that counts the jumps.  The
true-or-false-test for the <code>while</code> loop should test true so long as
point should jump forward, and false when point is at the end of the
definition.  We have already redefined the regular expression for this, so
the loop is straightforward:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(while (and (&lt; (point) end)
            (re-search-forward
             &quot;\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+[^ \t\n]*[ \t\n]*&quot; end t))
  (setq count (1+ count)))
</pre></div>

<p>The third part of the function definition returns the count of words and
symbols.  This part is the last expression within the body of the <code>let</code>
expression, and can be, very simply, the local variable <code>count</code>, which
when evaluated returns the count.
</p>
<p>Put together, the <code>count-words-in-defun</code> definition looks like this:
</p>
<span id="index-count_002dwords_002din_002ddefun"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun count-words-in-defun ()
  &quot;Return the number of words and symbols in a defun.&quot;
  (beginning-of-defun)
  (let ((count 0)
        (end (save-excursion (end-of-defun) (point))))
</pre><pre class="example">    (while
        (and (&lt; (point) end)
             (re-search-forward
              &quot;\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+[^ \t\n]*[ \t\n]*&quot;
              end t))
      (setq count (1+ count)))
    count))
</pre></div>

<p>How to test this? The function is not interactive, but it is easy to put a
wrapper around the function to make it interactive; we can use almost the
same code as for the recursive version of <code>count-words-example</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">Interactive version.</span>
(defun count-words-defun ()
  &quot;Number of words and symbols in a function definition.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (message
   &quot;Counting words and symbols in function definition ... &quot;)
</pre><pre class="example">  (let ((count (count-words-in-defun)))
    (cond
     ((zerop count)
      (message
       &quot;The definition does NOT have any words or symbols.&quot;))
</pre><pre class="example">     ((= 1 count)
      (message
       &quot;The definition has 1 word or symbol.&quot;))
     (t
      (message
       &quot;The definition has %d words or symbols.&quot; count)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Let&rsquo;s re-use <kbd>C-c =</kbd> as a convenient keybinding:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(global-set-key &quot;\C-c=&quot; 'count-words-defun)
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can try out <code>count-words-defun</code>: install both
<code>count-words-in-defun</code> and <code>count-words-defun</code>, and set the
keybinding.  Then copy the following to an Emacs Lisp buffer (like, for
instance, <samp>*scratch*</samp>), place the cursor within the definition, and use
the <kbd>C-c =</kbd> command.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun multiply-by-seven (number)
  &quot;Multiply NUMBER by seven.&quot;
  (* 7 number))
     &rArr; 10
</pre></div>

<p>Success! The definition has 10 words and symbols.
</p>
<p>The next problem is to count the numbers of words and symbols in several
definitions within a single file.
