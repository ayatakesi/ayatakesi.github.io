<span id="Point-and-Mark"></span><h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Point and Mark</h4>

<p>Before discussing <code>save-excursion</code>, however, it may be useful first to
review what point and mark are in GNU Emacs.  <em>Point</em> is the current
location of the cursor.  Wherever the cursor is, that is point.  More
precisely, on terminals where the cursor appears to be on top of a
character, point is immediately before the character.  In Emacs Lisp, point
is an integer.  The first character in a buffer is number one, the second is
number two, and so on.  The function <code>point</code> returns the current
position of the cursor as a number.  Each buffer has its own value for
point.
</p>
<p>The <em>mark</em> is another position in the buffer; its value can be set with
a command such as <kbd>C-<span class="key">SPC</span></kbd> (<code>set-mark-command</code>).  If a mark
has been set, you can use the command <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>
(<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>) to cause the cursor to jump to the mark and
set the mark to be the previous position of point.  In addition, if you set
another mark, the position of the previous mark is saved in the mark ring.
Many mark positions can be saved this way.  You can jump the cursor to a
saved mark by typing <kbd>C-u C-<span class="key">SPC</span></kbd> one or more times.
</p>
<p>The part of the buffer between point and mark is called <em>the region</em>.
Numerous commands work on the region, including <code>center-region</code>,
<code>count-words-region</code>, <code>kill-region</code>, and <code>print-region</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>save-excursion</code> special form saves the location of point and
restores this position after the code within the body of the special form is
evaluated by the Lisp interpreter.  Thus, if point were in the beginning of
a piece of text and some code moved point to the end of the buffer, the
<code>save-excursion</code> would put point back to where it was before, after the
expressions in the body of the function were evaluated.
</p>
<p>In Emacs, a function frequently moves point as part of its internal workings
even though a user would not expect this.  For example,
<code>count-words-region</code> moves point.  To prevent the user from being
bothered by jumps that are both unexpected and (from the user&rsquo;s point of
view) unnecessary, <code>save-excursion</code> is often used to keep point in the
location expected by the user.  The use of <code>save-excursion</code> is good
housekeeping.
</p>
<p>To make sure the house stays clean, <code>save-excursion</code> restores the value
of point even if something goes wrong in the code inside of it (or, to be
more precise and to use the proper jargon, &ldquo;in case of abnormal exit&rdquo;).
This feature is very helpful.
</p>
<p>In addition to recording the value of point, <code>save-excursion</code> keeps
track of the current buffer, and restores it, too.  This means you can write
code that will change the buffer and have <code>save-excursion</code> switch you
back to the original buffer.  This is how <code>save-excursion</code> is used in
<code>append-to-buffer</code>.  (See <a href="append_002dto_002dbuffer.html">The Definition of
<code>append-to-buffer</code></a>.)
