<span id="Body-of-mark_002dwhole_002dbuffer-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 Body of <code>mark-whole-buffer</code></h4>

<p>The body of the <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> function consists of three lines of
code:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(push-mark (point))
(push-mark (point-max) nil t)
(goto-char (point-min))
</pre></div>

<p>The first of these lines is the expression, <code>(push-mark (point))</code>.
</p>
<p>This line does exactly the same job as the first line of the body of the
<code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code> function, which is written
<code>(push-mark)</code>.  In both cases, the Lisp interpreter sets a mark at the
current position of the cursor.
</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the expression in <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> is written
<code>(push-mark (point))</code> and the expression in <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>
is written <code>(push-mark)</code>.  Perhaps whoever wrote the code did not know
that the arguments for <code>push-mark</code> are optional and that if
<code>push-mark</code> is not passed an argument, the function automatically sets
mark at the location of point by default.  Or perhaps the expression was
written so as to parallel the structure of the next line.  In any case, the
line causes Emacs to determine the position of point and set a mark there.
</p>
<p>In earlier versions of GNU Emacs, the next line of <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>
was <code>(push-mark (point-max))</code>.  This expression sets a mark at the
point in the buffer that has the highest number.  This will be the end of
the buffer (or, if the buffer is narrowed, the end of the accessible portion
of the buffer.  See <a href="Narrowing-_0026-Widening.html">Narrowing and Widening</a>, for
more about narrowing.)  After this mark has been set, the previous mark, the
one set at point, is no longer set, but Emacs remembers its position, just
as all other recent marks are always remembered.  This means that you can,
if you wish, go back to that position by typing <kbd>C-u C-<span class="key">SPC</span></kbd> twice.
</p>
<p>In GNU Emacs 22, the <code>(point-max)</code> is slightly more complicated.  The
line reads
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(push-mark (point-max) nil t)
</pre></div>

<p>The expression works nearly the same as before.  It sets a mark at the
highest numbered place in the buffer that it can.  However, in this version,
<code>push-mark</code> has two additional arguments.  The second argument to
<code>push-mark</code> is <code>nil</code>.  This tells the function it <em>should</em>
display a message that says &ldquo;Mark set&rdquo; when it pushes the mark.  The third
argument is <code>t</code>.  This tells <code>push-mark</code> to activate the mark when
Transient Mark mode is turned on.  Transient Mark mode highlights the
currently active region.  It is often turned off.
</p>
<p>Finally, the last line of the function is <code>(goto-char (point-min)))</code>.
This is written exactly the same way as it is written in
<code>beginning-of-buffer</code>.  The expression moves the cursor to the minimum
point in the buffer, that is, to the beginning of the buffer (or to the
beginning of the accessible portion of the buffer).  As a result of this,
point is placed at the beginning of the buffer and mark is set at the end of
the buffer.  The whole buffer is, therefore, the region.
