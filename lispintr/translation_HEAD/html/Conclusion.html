<span id="Conclusion-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">18 Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have now reached the end of this Introduction.  You have now learned
enough about programming in Emacs Lisp to set values, to write simple
<samp>.emacs</samp> files for yourself and your friends, and write simple
customizations and extensions to Emacs.
</p>
<p>This is a place to stop.  Or, if you wish, you can now go onward, and teach
yourself.
</p>
<p>You have learned some of the basic nuts and bolts of programming.  But only
some.  There are a great many more brackets and hinges that are easy to use
that we have not touched.
</p>
<p>A path you can follow right now lies among the sources to GNU Emacs and in
<cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>The Emacs Lisp sources are an adventure.  When you read the sources and come
across a function or expression that is unfamiliar, you need to figure out
or find out what it does.
</p>
<p>Go to the Reference Manual.  It is a thorough, complete, and fairly
easy-to-read description of Emacs Lisp.  It is written not only for experts,
but for people who know what you know.  (The <cite>Reference Manual</cite> comes
with the standard GNU Emacs distribution.  Like this introduction, it comes
as a Texinfo source file, so you can read it on your computer and as a
typeset, printed book.)
</p>
<p>Go to the other built-in help that is part of GNU Emacs: the built-in
documentation for all functions and variables, and
<code>xref-find-definitions</code>, the program that takes you to sources.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of how I explore the sources.  Because of its name,
<samp>simple.el</samp> is the file I looked at first, a long time ago.  As it
happens some of the functions in <samp>simple.el</samp> are complicated, or at
least look complicated at first sight.  The <code>open-line</code> function, for
example, looks complicated.
</p>
<p>You may want to walk through this function slowly, as we did with the
<code>forward-sentence</code> function.  (See <a href="forward_002dsentence.html">The
<code>forward-sentence</code> function</a>.)  Or you may want to skip that function
and look at another, such as <code>split-line</code>.  You don&rsquo;t need to read all
the functions.  According to <code>count-words-in-defun</code>, the
<code>split-line</code> function contains 102 words and symbols.
</p>
<p>Even though it is short, <code>split-line</code> contains expressions we have not
studied: <code>skip-chars-forward</code>, <code>indent-to</code>, <code>current-column</code>
and <code>insert-and-inherit</code>.
</p>
<p>Consider the <code>skip-chars-forward</code> function.  In GNU Emacs, you can find
out more about <code>skip-chars-forward</code> by typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
(<code>describe-function</code>) and the name of the function.  This gives you the
function documentation.
</p>
<p>You may be able to guess what is done by a well named function such as
<code>indent-to</code>; or you can look it up, too.  Incidentally, the
<code>describe-function</code> function itself is in <samp>help.el</samp>; it is one of
those long, but decipherable functions.  You can look up
<code>describe-function</code> using the <kbd>C-h f</kbd> command!
</p>
<p>In this instance, since the code is Lisp, the <samp>*Help*</samp> buffer contains
the name of the library containing the function&rsquo;s source.  You can put point
over the name of the library and press the <tt class="key">RET</tt> key, which in this
situation is bound to <code>help-follow</code>, and be taken directly to the
source, in the same way as <kbd>M-.</kbd> (<code>xref-find-definitions</code>).
</p>
<p>The definition for <code>describe-function</code> illustrates how to customize the
<code>interactive</code> expression without using the standard character codes;
and it shows how to create a temporary buffer.
</p>
<p>(The <code>indent-to</code> function is written in C rather than Emacs Lisp; it is
a built-in function.  <code>help-follow</code> takes you to its source as does
<code>xref-find-definitions</code>, when properly set up.)
</p>
<p>You can look at a function&rsquo;s source using <code>xref-find-definitions</code>,
which is bound to <kbd>M-.</kbd> Finally, you can find out what the Reference
Manual has to say by visiting the manual in Info, and typing <kbd>i</kbd>
(<code>Info-index</code>) and the name of the function, or by looking up the
function in the index to a printed copy of the manual.
</p>
<p>Similarly, you can find out what is meant by <code>insert-and-inherit</code>.
</p>
<p>Other interesting source files include <samp>paragraphs.el</samp>,
<samp>loaddefs.el</samp>, and <samp>loadup.el</samp>.  The <samp>paragraphs.el</samp> file
includes short, easily understood functions as well as longer ones.  The
<samp>loaddefs.el</samp> file contains the many standard autoloads and many
keymaps.  I have never looked at it all; only at parts.  <samp>loadup.el</samp> is
the file that loads the standard parts of Emacs; it tells you a great deal
about how Emacs is built.  (See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, for more about building.)
</p>
<p>As I said, you have learned some nuts and bolts; however, and very
importantly, we have hardly touched major aspects of programming; I have
said nothing about how to sort information, except to use the predefined
<code>sort</code> function; I have said nothing about how to store information,
except to use variables and lists; I have said nothing about how to write
programs that write programs.  These are topics for another, and different
kind of book, a different kind of learning.
</p>
<p>What you have done is learn enough for much practical work with GNU Emacs.
What you have done is get started.  This is the end of a beginning.
