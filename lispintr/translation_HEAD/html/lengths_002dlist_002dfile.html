<span id="lengths_002dlist_002dfile-in-Detail"></span><h3 class="section">14.6 <code>lengths-list-file</code> in Detail</h3>

<p>The core of the <code>lengths-list-file</code> function is a <code>while</code> loop
containing a function to move point forward defun by defun, and a function
to count the number of words and symbols in each defun.  This core must be
surrounded by functions that do various other tasks, including finding the
file, and ensuring that point starts out at the beginning of the file.  The
function definition looks like this:
<span id="index-lengths_002dlist_002dfile"></span>
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun lengths-list-file (filename)
  &quot;Return list of definitions' lengths within FILE.
The returned list is a list of numbers.
Each number is the number of words or
symbols in one function definition.&quot;
</pre><pre class="example">  (message &quot;Working on `%s' ... &quot; filename)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((buffer (find-file-noselect filename))
          (lengths-list))
      (set-buffer buffer)
      (setq buffer-read-only t)
      (widen)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward &quot;^(defun&quot; nil t)
        (setq lengths-list
              (cons (count-words-in-defun) lengths-list)))
      (kill-buffer buffer)
      lengths-list)))
</pre></div>

<p>The function is passed one argument, the name of the file on which it will
work.  It has four lines of documentation, but no interactive
specification.  Since people worry that a computer is broken if they don&rsquo;t
see anything going on, the first line of the body is a message.
</p>
<p>The next line contains a <code>save-excursion</code> that returns Emacs&rsquo;s
attention to the current buffer when the function completes.  This is useful
in case you embed this function in another function that presumes point is
restored to the original buffer.
</p>
<p>In the varlist of the <code>let</code> expression, Emacs finds the file and binds
the local variable <code>buffer</code> to the buffer containing the file.  At the
same time, Emacs creates <code>lengths-list</code> as a local variable.
</p>
<p>Next, Emacs switches its attention to the buffer.
</p>
<p>In the following line, Emacs makes the buffer read-only.  Ideally, this line
is not necessary.  None of the functions for counting words and symbols in a
function definition should change the buffer.  Besides, the buffer is not
going to be saved, even if it were changed.  This line is entirely the
consequence of great, perhaps excessive, caution.  The reason for the
caution is that this function and those it calls work on the sources for
Emacs and it is inconvenient if they are inadvertently modified.  It goes
without saying that I did not realize a need for this line until an
experiment went awry and started to modify my Emacs source files &hellip;
</p>
<p>Next comes a call to widen the buffer if it is narrowed.  This function is
usually not needed&mdash;Emacs creates a fresh buffer if none already exists;
but if a buffer visiting the file already exists Emacs returns that one.  In
this case, the buffer may be narrowed and must be widened.  If we wanted to
be fully user-friendly, we would arrange to save the restriction and the
location of point, but we won&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>The <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code> expression moves point to the beginning
of the buffer.
</p>
<p>Then comes a <code>while</code> loop in which the work of the function is carried
out.  In the loop, Emacs determines the length of each definition and
constructs a lengths&rsquo; list containing the information.
</p>
<p>Emacs kills the buffer after working through it.  This is to save space
inside of Emacs.  My version of GNU Emacs 19 contained over 300 source files
of interest; GNU Emacs 22 contains over a thousand source files.  Another
function will apply <code>lengths-list-file</code> to each of the files.
</p>
<p>Finally, the last expression within the <code>let</code> expression is the
<code>lengths-list</code> variable; its value is returned as the value of the
whole function.
</p>
<p>You can try this function by installing it in the usual fashion.  Then place
your cursor after the following expression and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>
(<code>eval-last-sexp</code>).
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(lengths-list-file
 &quot;/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1/lisp/emacs-lisp/debug.el&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>You may need to change the pathname of the file; the one here is for GNU
Emacs version 22.1.  To change the expression, copy it to the
<samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer and edit it.
</p>
<p>Also, to see the full length of the list, rather than a truncated version,
you may have to evaluate the following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(custom-set-variables '(eval-expression-print-length nil))
</pre></div>

<p>(See <a href="defcustom.html">Specifying Variables using <code>defcustom</code></a>.  Then
evaluate the <code>lengths-list-file</code> expression.)
</p>
<p>The lengths&rsquo; list for <samp>debug.el</samp> takes less than a second to produce
and looks like this in GNU Emacs 22:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(83 113 105 144 289 22 30 97 48 89 25 52 52 88 28 29 77 49 43 290 232 587)
</pre></div>

<p>(Using my old machine, the version 19 lengths&rsquo; list for <samp>debug.el</samp> took
seven seconds to produce and looked like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(75 41 80 62 20 45 44 68 45 12 34 235)
</pre></div>

<p>The newer version of <samp>debug.el</samp> contains more defuns than the earlier
one; and my new machine is much faster than the old one.)
</p>
<p>Note that the length of the last definition in the file is first in the
list.
