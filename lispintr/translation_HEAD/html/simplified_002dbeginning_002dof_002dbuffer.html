<span id="A-Simplified-beginning_002dof_002dbuffer-Definition"></span><h3 class="section">4.2 A Simplified <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> Definition</h3>
<span id="index-simplified_002dbeginning_002dof_002dbuffer"></span>

<p>The <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> command is a good function to start with
since you are likely to be familiar with it and it is easy to understand.
Used as an interactive command, <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> moves the cursor
to the beginning of the buffer, leaving the mark at the previous position.
It is generally bound to <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd>.
</p>
<p>In this section, we will discuss a shortened version of the function that
shows how it is most frequently used.  This shortened function works as
written, but it does not contain the code for a complex option.  In another
section, we will describe the entire function.  (See <a href="beginning_002dof_002dbuffer.html">Complete Definition of <code>beginning-of-buffer</code></a>.)
</p>
<p>Before looking at the code, let&rsquo;s consider what the function definition has
to contain: it must include an expression that makes the function
interactive so it can be called by typing <kbd>M-x beginning-of-buffer</kbd> or
by typing a keychord such as <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd>; it must include code to leave a mark
at the original position in the buffer; and it must include code to move the
cursor to the beginning of the buffer.
</p>
<p>Here is the complete text of the shortened version of the function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun simplified-beginning-of-buffer ()
  &quot;Move point to the beginning of the buffer;
leave mark at previous position.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (push-mark)
  (goto-char (point-min)))
</pre></div>

<p>Like all function definitions, this definition has five parts following the
macro <code>defun</code>:
</p>
<ol>
<li> The name: in this example, <code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code>.

</li><li> A list of the arguments: in this example, an empty list, <code>()</code>,

</li><li> The documentation string.

</li><li> The interactive expression.

</li><li> The body.
</li></ol>

<p>In this function definition, the argument list is empty; this means that
this function does not require any arguments.  (When we look at the
definition for the complete function, we will see that it may be passed an
optional argument.)
</p>
<p>The interactive expression tells Emacs that the function is intended to be
used interactively.  In this example, <code>interactive</code> does not have an
argument because <code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code> does not require one.
</p>
<p>The body of the function consists of the two lines:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(push-mark)
(goto-char (point-min))
</pre></div>

<p>The first of these lines is the expression, <code>(push-mark)</code>.  When this
expression is evaluated by the Lisp interpreter, it sets a mark at the
current position of the cursor, wherever that may be.  The position of this
mark is saved in the mark ring.
</p>
<p>The next line is <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>.  This expression jumps the
cursor to the minimum point in the buffer, that is, to the beginning of the
buffer (or to the beginning of the accessible portion of the buffer if it is
narrowed.  See <a href="Narrowing-_0026-Widening.html">Narrowing and Widening</a>.)
</p>
<p>The <code>push-mark</code> command sets a mark at the place where the cursor was
located before it was moved to the beginning of the buffer by the
<code>(goto-char (point-min))</code> expression.  Consequently, you can, if you
wish, go back to where you were originally by typing <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>.
</p>
<p>That is all there is to the function definition!
</p>
<span id="index-describe_002dfunction"></span>
<p>When you are reading code such as this and come upon an unfamiliar function,
such as <code>goto-char</code>, you can find out what it does by using the
<code>describe-function</code> command.  To use this command, type <kbd>C-h f</kbd> and
then type in the name of the function and press <tt class="key">RET</tt>.  The
<code>describe-function</code> command will print the function&rsquo;s documentation
string in a <samp>*Help*</samp> window.  For example, the documentation for
<code>goto-char</code> is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Set point to POSITION, a number or marker.
Beginning of buffer is position (point-min), end is (point-max).
</pre></div>

<p>The function&rsquo;s one argument is the desired position.
</p>
<p>(The prompt for <code>describe-function</code> will offer you the symbol under or
preceding the cursor, so you can save typing by positioning the cursor right
over or after the function and then typing <kbd>C-h f <span class="key">RET</span></kbd>.)
</p>
<p>The <code>end-of-buffer</code> function definition is written in the same way as
the <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> definition except that the body of the
function contains the expression <code>(goto-char (point-max))</code> in place of
<code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>.
