<span id="what_002dline-1"></span><h3 class="section">6.2 <code>what-line</code></h3>
<span id="index-what_002dline"></span>
<span id="index-Widening_002c-example-of"></span>

<p>The <code>what-line</code> command tells you the number of the line in which the
cursor is located.  The function illustrates the use of the
<code>save-restriction</code> and <code>save-excursion</code> commands.  Here is the
original text of the function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun what-line ()
  &quot;Print the current line number (in the buffer) of point.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (save-restriction
    (widen)
    (save-excursion
      (beginning-of-line)
      (message &quot;Line %d&quot;
               (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre></div>

<p>(In modern versions of GNU Emacs, the <code>what-line</code> function has been
expanded to tell you your line number in a narrowed buffer as well as your
line number in a widened buffer.  The modern version is more complex than
the version shown here.  If you feel adventurous, you might want to look at
it after figuring out how this version works.  You will probably need to use
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>).  The newer version uses a
conditional to determine whether the buffer has been narrowed.
</p>
<p>(Also, it uses <code>line-number-at-pos</code>, which among other simple
expressions, such as <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>, moves point to the
beginning of the current line with <code>(forward-line 0)</code> rather than
<code>beginning-of-line</code>.)
</p>
<p>The <code>what-line</code> function as shown here has a documentation line and is
interactive, as you would expect.  The next two lines use the functions
<code>save-restriction</code> and <code>widen</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>save-restriction</code> special form notes whatever narrowing is in
effect, if any, in the current buffer and restores that narrowing after the
code in the body of the <code>save-restriction</code> has been evaluated.
</p>
<p>The <code>save-restriction</code> special form is followed by <code>widen</code>.  This
function undoes any narrowing the current buffer may have had when
<code>what-line</code> was called.  (The narrowing that was there is the narrowing
that <code>save-restriction</code> remembers.)  This widening makes it possible
for the line counting commands to count from the beginning of the buffer.
Otherwise, they would have been limited to counting within the accessible
region.  Any original narrowing is restored just before the completion of
the function by the <code>save-restriction</code> special form.
</p>
<p>The call to <code>widen</code> is followed by <code>save-excursion</code>, which saves
the location of the cursor (i.e., of point), and restores it after the code
in the body of the <code>save-excursion</code> uses the <code>beginning-of-line</code>
function to move point.
</p>
<p>(Note that the <code>(widen)</code> expression comes between the
<code>save-restriction</code> and <code>save-excursion</code> special forms.  When you
write the two <code>save- &hellip;</code> expressions in sequence, write
<code>save-excursion</code> outermost.)
</p>
<p>The last two lines of the <code>what-line</code> function are functions to count
the number of lines in the buffer and then print the number in the echo
area.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(message &quot;Line %d&quot;
         (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>message</code> function prints a one-line message at the bottom of the
Emacs screen.  The first argument is inside of quotation marks and is
printed as a string of characters.  However, it may contain a &lsquo;<samp>%d</samp>&rsquo;
expression to print a following argument.  &lsquo;<samp>%d</samp>&rsquo; prints the argument as
a decimal, so the message will say something such as &lsquo;<samp>Line 243</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The number that is printed in place of the &lsquo;<samp>%d</samp>&rsquo; is computed by the last
line of the function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))
</pre></div>


<p>What this does is count the lines from the first position of the buffer,
indicated by the <code>1</code>, up to <code>(point)</code>, and then add one to that
number.  (The <code>1+</code> function adds one to its argument.)  We add one to
it because line 2 has only one line before it, and <code>count-lines</code> counts
only the lines <em>before</em> the current line.
</p>
<p>After <code>count-lines</code> has done its job, and the message has been printed
in the echo area, the <code>save-excursion</code> restores point to its original
position; and <code>save-restriction</code> restores the original narrowing, if
any.
