<span id="Free-Software-and-Free-Manuals-1"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Free Software and Free Manuals</h2>

<p><strong>by Richard M. Stallman</strong>
</p><br>

<p>The biggest deficiency in free operating systems is not in the software&mdash;it
is the lack of good free manuals that we can include in these systems.  Many
of our most important programs do not come with full manuals.  Documentation
is an essential part of any software package; when an important free
software package does not come with a free manual, that is a major gap.  We
have many such gaps today.
</p>
<p>Once upon a time, many years ago, I thought I would learn Perl.  I got a
copy of a free manual, but I found it hard to read.  When I asked Perl users
about alternatives, they told me that there were better introductory
manuals&mdash;but those were not free.
</p>
<p>Why was this? The authors of the good manuals had written them for O&rsquo;Reilly
Associates, which published them with restrictive terms&mdash;no copying, no
modification, source files not available&mdash;which exclude them from the free
software community.
</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the first time this sort of thing has happened, and (to our
community&rsquo;s great loss) it was far from the last.  Proprietary manual
publishers have enticed a great many authors to restrict their manuals since
then.  Many times I have heard a GNU user eagerly tell me about a manual
that he is writing, with which he expects to help the GNU project&mdash;and then
had my hopes dashed, as he proceeded to explain that he had signed a
contract with a publisher that would restrict it so that we cannot use it.
</p>
<p>Given that writing good English is a rare skill among programmers, we can
ill afford to lose manuals this way.
</p>
<p>Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not price.
The problem with these manuals was not that O&rsquo;Reilly Associates charged a
price for printed copies&mdash;that in itself is fine.  The Free Software
Foundation <a href="https://shop.fsf.org">sells printed copies</a> of free
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html">GNU manuals</a>, too.  But GNU manuals
are available in source code form, while these manuals are available only on
paper.  GNU manuals come with permission to copy and modify; the Perl
manuals do not.  These restrictions are the problems.
</p>
<p>The criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for free
software: it is a matter of giving all users certain freedoms.
Redistribution (including commercial redistribution) must be permitted, so
that the manual can accompany every copy of the program, on-line or on
paper.  Permission for modification is crucial too.
</p>
<p>As a general rule, I don&rsquo;t believe that it is essential for people to have
permission to modify all sorts of articles and books.  The issues for
writings are not necessarily the same as those for software.  For example, I
don&rsquo;t think you or I are obliged to give permission to modify articles like
this one, which describe our actions and our views.
</p>
<p>But there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial for
documentation for free software.  When people exercise their right to modify
the software, and add or change its features, if they are conscientious they
will change the manual too&mdash;so they can provide accurate and usable
documentation with the modified program.  A manual which forbids programmers
to be conscientious and finish the job, or more precisely requires them to
write a new manual from scratch if they change the program, does not fill
our community&rsquo;s needs.
</p>
<p>While a blanket prohibition on modification is unacceptable, some kinds of
limits on the method of modification pose no problem.  For example,
requirements to preserve the original author&rsquo;s copyright notice, the
distribution terms, or the list of authors, are ok.  It is also no problem
to require modified versions to include notice that they were modified, even
to have entire sections that may not be deleted or changed, as long as these
sections deal with nontechnical topics.  (Some GNU manuals have them.)
</p>
<p>These kinds of restrictions are not a problem because, as a practical
matter, they don&rsquo;t stop the conscientious programmer from adapting the
manual to fit the modified program.  In other words, they don&rsquo;t block the
free software community from making full use of the manual.
</p>
<p>However, it must be possible to modify all the technical content of the
manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual media, through all
the usual channels; otherwise, the restrictions do block the community, the
manual is not free, and so we need another manual.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is often hard to find someone to write another manual when
a proprietary manual exists.  The obstacle is that many users think that a
proprietary manual is good enough&mdash;so they don&rsquo;t see the need to write a
free manual.  They do not see that the free operating system has a gap that
needs filling.
</p>
<p>Why do users think that proprietary manuals are good enough? Some have not
considered the issue.  I hope this article will do something to change that.
</p>
<p>Other users consider proprietary manuals acceptable for the same reason so
many people consider proprietary software acceptable: they judge in purely
practical terms, not using freedom as a criterion.  These people are
entitled to their opinions, but since those opinions spring from values
which do not include freedom, they are no guide for those of us who do value
freedom.
</p>
<p>Please spread the word about this issue.  We continue to lose manuals to
proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that proprietary manuals are
not sufficient, perhaps the next person who wants to help GNU by writing
documentation will realize, before it is too late, that he must above all
make it free.
</p>
<p>We can also encourage commercial publishers to sell free, copylefted manuals
instead of proprietary ones.  One way you can help this is to check the
distribution terms of a manual before you buy it, and prefer copylefted
manuals to non-copylefted ones.
