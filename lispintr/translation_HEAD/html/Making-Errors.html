<span id="Generate-an-Error-Message"></span><h3 class="section">1.3 Generate an Error Message</h3>
<span id="index-Generate-an-error-message"></span>
<span id="index-Error-message-generation"></span>

<p>Partly so you won&rsquo;t worry if you do it accidentally, we will now give a
command to the Lisp interpreter that generates an error message.  This is a
harmless activity; and indeed, we will often try to generate error messages
intentionally.  Once you understand the jargon, error messages can be
informative.  Instead of being called &ldquo;error&rdquo; messages, they should be
called &ldquo;help&rdquo; messages.  They are like signposts to a traveler in a
strange country; deciphering them can be hard, but once understood, they can
point the way.
</p>
<p>The error message is generated by a built-in GNU Emacs debugger.  We will
enter the debugger.  You get out of the debugger by typing <code>q</code>.
</p>
<p>What we will do is evaluate a list that is not quoted and does not have a
meaningful command as its first element.  Here is a list almost exactly the
same as the one we just used, but without the single-quote in front of it.
Position the cursor right after it and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(this is an unquoted list)
</pre></div>

<p>A <samp>*Backtrace*</samp> window will open up and you should see the following in
it:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function this)
  (this is an unquoted list)
  eval((this is an unquoted list) nil)
  elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil)
  eval-last-sexp(nil)
  funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil)
  call-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil nil)
  command-execute(eval-last-sexp)
---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre></div>

<p>Your cursor will be in this window (you may have to wait a few seconds
before it becomes visible).  To quit the debugger and make the debugger
window go away, type:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">q
</pre></div>

<p>Please type <kbd>q</kbd> right now, so you become confident that you can get out
of the debugger.  Then, type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> again to re-enter it.
</p>
<span id="index-function-defined"></span>
<p>Based on what we already know, we can almost read this error message.
</p>
<p>You read the <samp>*Backtrace*</samp> buffer from the bottom up; it tells you what
Emacs did.  When you typed <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>, you made an interactive call to
the command <code>eval-last-sexp</code>.  <code>eval</code> is an abbreviation for
&ldquo;evaluate&rdquo; and <code>sexp</code> is an abbreviation for &ldquo;symbolic
expression&rdquo;.  The command means &ldquo;evaluate last symbolic expression&rdquo;,
which is the expression just before your cursor.
</p>
<p>Each line above tells you what the Lisp interpreter evaluated next.  The
most recent action is at the top.  The buffer is called the
<samp>*Backtrace*</samp> buffer because it enables you to track Emacs backwards.
</p>
<p>At the top of the <samp>*Backtrace*</samp> buffer, you see the line:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function this)
</pre></div>

<p>The Lisp interpreter tried to evaluate the first atom of the list, the word
&lsquo;<samp>this</samp>&rsquo;.  It is this action that generated the error message
&lsquo;<samp>void-function this</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The message contains the words &lsquo;<samp>void-function</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>this</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<span id="index-function-defined-1"></span>
<p>The word &lsquo;<samp>function</samp>&rsquo; was mentioned once before.  It is a very important
word.  For our purposes, we can define it by saying that a <em>function</em> is
a set of instructions to the computer that tell the computer to do
something.
</p>
<p>Now we can begin to understand the error message: &lsquo;<samp>void-function
this</samp>&rsquo;.  The function (that is, the word &lsquo;<samp>this</samp>&rsquo;) does not have a
definition of any set of instructions for the computer to carry out.
</p>
<p>The slightly odd word, &lsquo;<samp>void-function</samp>&rsquo;, is designed to cover the way
Emacs Lisp is implemented, which is that when a symbol does not have a
function definition attached to it, the place that should contain the
instructions is void.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, since we were able to add 2 plus 2 successfully, by
evaluating <code>(+ 2 2)</code>, we can infer that the symbol <code>+</code> must have a
set of instructions for the computer to obey and those instructions must be
to add the numbers that follow the <code>+</code>.
</p>
<p>It is possible to prevent Emacs entering the debugger in cases like this.
We do not explain how to do that here, but we will mention what the result
looks like, because you may encounter a similar situation if there is a bug
in some Emacs code that you are using.  In such cases, you will see only one
line of error message; it will appear in the echo area and look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Symbol's function definition is void: this
</pre></div>

<p>The message goes away as soon as you type a key, even just to move the
cursor.
</p>
<p>We know the meaning of the word &lsquo;<samp>Symbol</samp>&rsquo;.  It refers to the first atom
of the list, the word &lsquo;<samp>this</samp>&rsquo;.  The word &lsquo;<samp>function</samp>&rsquo; refers to the
instructions that tell the computer what to do.  (Technically, the symbol
tells the computer where to find the instructions, but this is a
complication we can ignore for the moment.)
</p>
<p>The error message can be understood: &lsquo;<samp>Symbol's function definition is
void: this</samp>&rsquo;.  The symbol (that is, the word &lsquo;<samp>this</samp>&rsquo;) lacks
instructions for the computer to carry out.
