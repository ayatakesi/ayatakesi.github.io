<span id="The-defun-Macro"></span><h3 class="section">3.1 The <code>defun</code> Macro</h3>
<span id="index-defun"></span>

<span id="index-function-definition-defined"></span>
<p>In Lisp, a symbol such as <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> has code attached to it
that tells the computer what to do when the function is called.  This code
is called the <em>function definition</em> and is created by evaluating a Lisp
expression that starts with the symbol <code>defun</code> (which is an
abbreviation for <em>define function</em>).
</p>
<p>In subsequent sections, we will look at function definitions from the Emacs
source code, such as <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>.  In this section, we will
describe a simple function definition so you can see how it looks.  This
function definition uses arithmetic because it makes for a simple example.
Some people dislike examples using arithmetic; however, if you are such a
person, do not despair.  Hardly any of the code we will study in the
remainder of this introduction involves arithmetic or mathematics.  The
examples mostly involve text in one way or another.
</p>
<p>A function definition has up to five parts following the word <code>defun</code>:
</p>
<ol>
<li> The name of the symbol to which the function definition should be attached.

</li><li> A list of the arguments that will be passed to the function.  If no
arguments will be passed to the function, this is an empty list, <code>()</code>.

</li><li> Documentation describing the function.  (Technically optional, but strongly
recommended.)

</li><li> Optionally, an expression to make the function interactive so you can use it
by typing <kbd>M-x</kbd> and then the name of the function; or by typing an
appropriate key or keychord.

</li><li> <span id="index-body-defined"></span>
The code that instructs the computer what to do: the <em>body</em> of the
function definition.
</li></ol>

<p>It is helpful to think of the five parts of a function definition as being
organized in a template, with slots for each part:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun <var>function-name</var> (<var>arguments</var>&hellip;)
  &quot;<var>optional-documentation</var>&hellip;&quot;
  (interactive <var>argument-passing-info</var>)     ; <span class="roman">optional</span>
  <var>body</var>&hellip;)
</pre></div>

<p>As an example, here is the code for a function that multiplies its argument
by 7.  (This example is not interactive.  See <a href="Interactive.html">Making a
Function Interactive</a>, for that information.)
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun multiply-by-seven (number)
  &quot;Multiply NUMBER by seven.&quot;
  (* 7 number))
</pre></div>

<p>This definition begins with a parenthesis and the symbol <code>defun</code>,
followed by the name of the function.
</p>
<span id="index-argument-list-defined"></span>
<p>The name of the function is followed by a list that contains the arguments
that will be passed to the function.  This list is called the <em>argument
list</em>.  In this example, the list has only one element, the symbol,
<code>number</code>.  When the function is used, the symbol will be bound to the
value that is used as the argument to the function.
</p>
<p>Instead of choosing the word <code>number</code> for the name of the argument, I
could have picked any other name.  For example, I could have chosen the word
<code>multiplicand</code>.  I picked the word &ldquo;number&rdquo; because it tells what
kind of value is intended for this slot; but I could just as well have
chosen the word &ldquo;multiplicand&rdquo; to indicate the role that the value placed
in this slot will play in the workings of the function.  I could have called
it <code>foogle</code>, but that would have been a bad choice because it would not
tell humans what it means.  The choice of name is up to the programmer and
should be chosen to make the meaning of the function clear.
</p>
<p>Indeed, you can choose any name you wish for a symbol in an argument list,
even the name of a symbol used in some other function: the name you use in
an argument list is private to that particular definition.  In that
definition, the name refers to a different entity than any use of the same
name outside the function definition.  Suppose you have a nick-name
&ldquo;Shorty&rdquo; in your family; when your family members refer to &ldquo;Shorty&rdquo;,
they mean you.  But outside your family, in a movie, for example, the name
&ldquo;Shorty&rdquo; refers to someone else.  Because a name in an argument list is
private to the function definition, you can change the value of such a
symbol inside the body of a function without changing its value outside the
function.  The effect is similar to that produced by a <code>let</code>
expression.  (See <a href="let.html"><code>let</code></a>.)
</p>

<p>The argument list is followed by the documentation string that describes the
function.  This is what you see when you type <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-h</span>&nbsp;f</kbd><!-- /@w --> and the name
of a function.  Incidentally, when you write a documentation string like
this, you should make the first line a complete sentence since some
commands, such as <code>apropos</code>, print only the first line of a multi-line
documentation string.  Also, you should not indent the second line of a
documentation string, if you have one, because that looks odd when you use
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>).  The documentation string is
optional, but it is so useful, it should be included in almost every
function you write.
</p>
<span id="index-_002a-_0028multiplication_0029"></span>
<p>The third line of the example consists of the body of the function
definition.  (Most functions&rsquo; definitions, of course, are longer than this.)
In this function, the body is the list, <code>(* 7 number)</code>, which says to
multiply the value of <var>number</var> by 7.  (In Emacs Lisp, <code>*</code> is the
function for multiplication, just as <code>+</code> is the function for addition.)
</p>
<p>When you use the <code>multiply-by-seven</code> function, the argument
<code>number</code> evaluates to the actual number you want used.  Here is an
example that shows how <code>multiply-by-seven</code> is used; but don&rsquo;t try to
evaluate this yet!
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(multiply-by-seven 3)
</pre></div>

<p>The symbol <code>number</code>, specified in the function definition in the next
section, is bound to the value 3 in the actual use of the function.  Note
that although <code>number</code> was inside parentheses in the function
definition, the argument passed to the <code>multiply-by-seven</code> function is
not in parentheses.  The parentheses are written in the function definition
so the computer can figure out where the argument list ends and the rest of
the function definition begins.
</p>
<p>If you evaluate this example, you are likely to get an error message.  (Go
ahead, try it!)  This is because we have written the function definition,
but not yet told the computer about the definition&mdash;we have not yet loaded
the function definition in Emacs.  Installing a function is the process that
tells the Lisp interpreter the definition of the function.  Installation is
described in the next section.
