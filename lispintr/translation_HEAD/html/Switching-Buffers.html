<span id="Switching-Buffers-1"></span><h3 class="section">2.3 Switching Buffers</h3>
<span id="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer"></span>
<span id="index-set_002dbuffer"></span>
<span id="index-Switching-to-a-buffer"></span>

<p>The <code>other-buffer</code> function actually provides a buffer when it is used
as an argument to a function that requires one.  We can see this by using
<code>other-buffer</code> and <code>switch-to-buffer</code> to switch to a different
buffer.
</p>
<p>But first, a brief introduction to the <code>switch-to-buffer</code> function.
When you switched back and forth from Info to the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer to
evaluate <code>(buffer-name)</code>, you most likely typed <kbd>C-x b</kbd> and then
typed <samp>*scratch*</samp><a id="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a> when prompted in the minibuffer for the name of the buffer to
which you wanted to switch.  The keystrokes, <kbd>C-x b</kbd>, cause the Lisp
interpreter to evaluate the interactive function <code>switch-to-buffer</code>.
As we said before, this is how Emacs works: different keystrokes call or run
different functions.  For example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> calls <code>forward-char</code>,
<kbd>M-e</kbd> calls <code>forward-sentence</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>By writing <code>switch-to-buffer</code> in an expression, and giving it a buffer
to switch to, we can switch buffers just the way <kbd>C-x b</kbd> does:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(switch-to-buffer (other-buffer))
</pre></div>

<p>The symbol <code>switch-to-buffer</code> is the first element of the list, so the
Lisp interpreter will treat it as a function and carry out the instructions
that are attached to it.  But before doing that, the interpreter will note
that <code>other-buffer</code> is inside parentheses and work on that symbol
first.  <code>other-buffer</code> is the first (and in this case, the only)
element of this list, so the Lisp interpreter calls or runs the function.
It returns another buffer.  Next, the interpreter runs
<code>switch-to-buffer</code>, passing to it, as an argument, the other buffer,
which is what Emacs will switch to.  If you are reading this in Info, try
this now.  Evaluate the expression.  (To get back, type <kbd>C-x b
<span class="key">RET</span></kbd>.)<a id="DOCF8" href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a>
</p>
<p>In the programming examples in later sections of this document, you will see
the function <code>set-buffer</code> more often than <code>switch-to-buffer</code>.
This is because of a difference between computer programs and humans: humans
have eyes and expect to see the buffer on which they are working on their
computer terminals.  This is so obvious, it almost goes without saying.
However, programs do not have eyes.  When a computer program works on a
buffer, that buffer does not need to be visible on the screen.
</p>
<p><code>switch-to-buffer</code> is designed for humans and does two different
things: it switches the buffer to which Emacs&rsquo;s attention is directed; and
it switches the buffer displayed in the window to the new buffer.
<code>set-buffer</code>, on the other hand, does only one thing: it switches the
attention of the computer program to a different buffer.  The buffer on the
screen remains unchanged (of course, normally nothing happens there until
the command finishes running).
</p>
<span id="index-call-defined"></span>
<p>Also, we have just introduced another jargon term, the word <em>call</em>.
When you evaluate a list in which the first symbol is a function, you are
calling that function.  The use of the term comes from the notion of the
function as an entity that can do something for you if you call it&mdash;just as
a plumber is an entity who can fix a leak if you call him or her.

<h5><a id="FOOT7" href="#DOCF7">(7)</a></h5>
<p>Or rather, to save typing, you probably only
typed <kbd>RET</kbd> if the default buffer was <samp>*scratch*</samp>, or if it was
different, then you typed just part of the name, such as <code>*sc</code>, pressed
your <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to cause it to expand to the full name, and then typed
<kbd>RET</kbd>.</p>
<h5><a id="FOOT8" href="#DOCF8">(8)</a></h5>
<p>Remember, this expression will move you to your most
recent other buffer that you cannot see.  If you really want to go to your
most recently selected buffer, even if you can still see it, you need to
evaluate the following more complex expression:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(switch-to-buffer (other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
</pre></div>
<p>In this case, the first argument to <code>other-buffer</code> tells it which
buffer to skip&mdash;the current one&mdash;and the second argument tells
<code>other-buffer</code> it is OK to switch to a visible buffer.  In regular use,
<code>switch-to-buffer</code> takes you to a buffer not visible in windows since
you would most likely use <kbd>C-x o</kbd> (<code>other-window</code>) to go to another
visible buffer.</p>
