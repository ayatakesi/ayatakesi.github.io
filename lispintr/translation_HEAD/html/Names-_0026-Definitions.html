<span id="index-Symbol-names"></span>

<p>We can articulate another characteristic of Lisp based on what we have
discussed so far&mdash;an important characteristic: a symbol, like <code>+</code>, is
not itself the set of instructions for the computer to carry out.  Instead,
the symbol is used, perhaps temporarily, as a way of locating the definition
or set of instructions.  What we see is the name through which the
instructions can be found.  Names of people work the same way.  I can be
referred to as &lsquo;<samp>Bob</samp>&rsquo;; however, I am not the letters &lsquo;<samp>B</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; but am, or was, the consciousness consistently associated with a
particular life-form.  The name is not me, but it can be used to refer to
me.
</p>
<p>In Lisp, one set of instructions can be attached to several names.  For
example, the computer instructions for adding numbers can be linked to the
symbol <code>plus</code> as well as to the symbol <code>+</code> (and are in some
dialects of Lisp).  Among humans, I can be referred to as &lsquo;<samp>Robert</samp>&rsquo; as
well as &lsquo;<samp>Bob</samp>&rsquo; and by other words as well.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, a symbol can have only one function definition attached
to it at a time.  Otherwise, the computer would be confused as to which
definition to use.  If this were the case among people, only one person in
the world could be named &lsquo;<samp>Bob</samp>&rsquo;.  However, the function definition to
which the name refers can be changed readily.  (See <a href="Install.html">Install a
Function Definition</a>.)
</p>
<p>Since Emacs Lisp is large, it is customary to name symbols in a way that
identifies the part of Emacs to which the function belongs.  Thus, all the
names for functions that deal with Texinfo start with &lsquo;<samp>texinfo-</samp>&rsquo; and
those for functions that deal with reading mail start with &lsquo;<samp>rmail-</samp>&rsquo;.
