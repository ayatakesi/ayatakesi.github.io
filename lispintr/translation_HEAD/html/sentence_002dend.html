<span id="The-Regular-Expression-for-sentence_002dend"></span><h3 class="section">12.1 The Regular Expression for <code>sentence-end</code></h3>
<span id="index-sentence_002dend"></span>

<p>The symbol <code>sentence-end</code> is bound to the pattern that marks the end of
a sentence.  What should this regular expression be?
</p>
<p>Clearly, a sentence may be ended by a period, a question mark, or an
exclamation mark.  Indeed, in English, only clauses that end with one of
those three characters should be considered the end of a sentence.  This
means that the pattern should include the character set:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[.?!]
</pre></div>

<p>However, we do not want <code>forward-sentence</code> merely to jump to a period,
a question mark, or an exclamation mark, because such a character might be
used in the middle of a sentence.  A period, for example, is used after
abbreviations.  So other information is needed.
</p>
<p>According to convention, you type two spaces after every sentence, but only
one space after a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark in the
body of a sentence.  So a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark
followed by two spaces is a good indicator of an end of sentence.  However,
in a file, the two spaces may instead be a tab or the end of a line.  This
means that the regular expression should include these three items as
alternatives.
</p>
<p>This group of alternatives will look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\\($\\| \\|  \\)
       ^   ^^
      TAB  SPC
</pre></div>

<p>Here, &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; indicates the end of the line, and I have pointed out where
the tab and two spaces are inserted in the expression.  Both are inserted by
putting the actual characters into the expression.
</p>
<p>Two backslashes, &lsquo;<samp>\\</samp>&rsquo;, are required before the parentheses and vertical
bars: the first backslash quotes the following backslash in Emacs; and the
second indicates that the following character, the parenthesis or the
vertical bar, is special.
</p>
<p>Also, a sentence may be followed by one or more carriage returns, like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[
]*
</pre></div>

<p>Like tabs and spaces, a carriage return is inserted into a regular
expression by inserting it literally.  The asterisk indicates that the
<tt class="key">RET</tt> is repeated zero or more times.
</p>
<p>But a sentence end does not consist only of a period, a question mark or an
exclamation mark followed by appropriate space: a closing quotation mark or
a closing brace of some kind may precede the space.  Indeed more than one
such mark or brace may precede the space.  These require a expression that
looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[]\&quot;')}]*
</pre></div>

<p>In this expression, the first &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo; is the first character in the
expression; the second character is &lsquo;<samp>&quot;</samp>&rsquo;, which is preceded by a
&lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo; to tell Emacs the &lsquo;<samp>&quot;</samp>&rsquo; is <em>not</em> special.  The last three
characters are &lsquo;<samp>'</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>)</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>}</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>All this suggests what the regular expression pattern for matching the end
of a sentence should be; and, indeed, if we evaluate <code>sentence-end</code> we
find that it returns the following value:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">sentence-end
     &rArr; &quot;[.?!][]\&quot;')}]*\\($\\|     \\|  \\)[
]*&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>(Well, not in GNU Emacs 22; that is because of an effort to make the process
simpler and to handle more glyphs and languages.  When the value of
<code>sentence-end</code> is <code>nil</code>, then use the value defined by the
function <code>sentence-end</code>.  (Here is a use of the difference between a
value and a function in Emacs Lisp.)  The function returns a value
constructed from the variables <code>sentence-end-base</code>,
<code>sentence-end-double-space</code>, <code>sentence-end-without-period</code>, and
<code>sentence-end-without-space</code>.  The critical variable is
<code>sentence-end-base</code>; its global value is similar to the one described
above but it also contains two additional quotation marks.  These have
differing degrees of curliness.  The <code>sentence-end-without-period</code>
variable, when true, tells Emacs that a sentence may end without a period,
such as text in Thai.)
