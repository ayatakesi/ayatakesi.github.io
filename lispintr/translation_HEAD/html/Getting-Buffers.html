<p>The <code>buffer-name</code> function returns the <em>name</em> of the buffer; to
get the buffer <em>itself</em>, a different function is needed: the
<code>current-buffer</code> function.  If you use this function in code, what you
get is the buffer itself.
</p>
<p>A name and the object or entity to which the name refers are different from
each other.  You are not your name.  You are a person to whom others refer
by name.  If you ask to speak to George and someone hands you a card with
the letters &lsquo;<samp>G</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>e</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>g</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>e</samp>&rsquo;
written on it, you might be amused, but you would not be satisfied.  You do
not want to speak to the name, but to the person to whom the name refers.  A
buffer is similar: the name of the scratch buffer is <samp>*scratch*</samp>, but
the name is not the buffer.  To get a buffer itself, you need to use a
function such as <code>current-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>However, there is a slight complication: if you evaluate
<code>current-buffer</code> in an expression on its own, as we will do here, what
you see is a printed representation of the name of the buffer without the
contents of the buffer.  Emacs works this way for two reasons: the buffer
may be thousands of lines long&mdash;too long to be conveniently displayed; and,
another buffer may have the same contents but a different name, and it is
important to distinguish between them.
</p>
<p>Here is an expression containing the function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(current-buffer)
</pre></div>

<p>If you evaluate this expression in Info in Emacs in the usual way,
<samp>#&lt;buffer *info*&gt;</samp> will appear in the echo area.  The special format
indicates that the buffer itself is being returned, rather than just its
name.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, while you can type a number or symbol into a program, you
cannot do that with the printed representation of a buffer: the only way to
get a buffer itself is with a function such as <code>current-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>A related function is <code>other-buffer</code>.  This returns the most recently
selected buffer other than the one you are in currently, not a printed
representation of its name.  If you have recently switched back and forth
from the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer, <code>other-buffer</code> will return that
buffer.
</p>
<p>You can see this by evaluating the expression:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(other-buffer)
</pre></div>

<p>You should see <samp>#&lt;buffer *scratch*&gt;</samp> appear in the echo area, or the
name of whatever other buffer you switched back from most
recently<a id="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4 class="footnotes-heading">Footnotes</h4>

<h5><a id="FOOT6" href="#DOCF6">(6)</a></h5>
<p>Actually, by default, if the buffer from which you just
switched is visible to you in another window, <code>other-buffer</code> will
choose the most recent buffer that you cannot see; this is a subtlety that I
often forget.</p>
