<span id="Buffer-Names-1"></span><h3 class="section">2.1 Buffer Names</h3>
<span id="index-buffer_002dname"></span>
<span id="index-buffer_002dfile_002dname"></span>

<p>The two functions, <code>buffer-name</code> and <code>buffer-file-name</code>, show the
difference between a file and a buffer.  When you evaluate the following
expression, <code>(buffer-name)</code>, the name of the buffer appears in the echo
area.  When you evaluate <code>(buffer-file-name)</code>, the name of the file to
which the buffer refers appears in the echo area.  Usually, the name
returned by <code>(buffer-name)</code> is the same as the name of the file to
which it refers, and the name returned by <code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is the
full path-name of the file.
</p>
<p>A file and a buffer are two different entities.  A file is information
recorded permanently in the computer (unless you delete it).  A buffer, on
the other hand, is information inside of Emacs that will vanish at the end
of the editing session (or when you kill the buffer).  Usually, a buffer
contains information that you have copied from a file; we say the buffer is
<em>visiting</em> that file.  This copy is what you work on and modify.
Changes to the buffer do not change the file, until you save the buffer.
When you save the buffer, the buffer is copied to the file and is thus saved
permanently.
</p>
<p>If you are reading this in Info inside of GNU Emacs, you can evaluate each
of the following expressions by positioning the cursor after it and typing
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(buffer-name)

(buffer-file-name)
</pre></div>

<p>When I do this in Info, the value returned by evaluating
<code>(buffer-name)</code> is <samp>&quot;*info*&quot;</samp>, and the value returned by
evaluating <code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is <samp>nil</samp>.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, while I am writing this document, the value returned by
evaluating <code>(buffer-name)</code> is <samp>&quot;introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>, and the
value returned by evaluating <code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is
<samp>&quot;/gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>.
</p>
<span id="index-nil_002c-history-of-word"></span>
<p>The former is the name of the buffer and the latter is the name of the
file.  In Info, the buffer name is <samp>&quot;*info*&quot;</samp>.  Info does not point to
any file, so the result of evaluating <code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is
<samp>nil</samp>.  The symbol <code>nil</code> is from the Latin word for &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;;
in this case, it means that the buffer is not associated with any file.  (In
Lisp, <code>nil</code> is also used to mean &ldquo;false&rdquo; and is a synonym for the
empty list, <code>()</code>.)
</p>
<p>When I am writing, the name of my buffer is <samp>&quot;introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>.
The name of the file to which it points is
<samp>&quot;/gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>.
</p>
<p>(In the expressions, the parentheses tell the Lisp interpreter to treat
<code><span class="nolinebreak">buffer-name</span></code><!-- /@w --> and <code><span class="nolinebreak">buffer-file-name</span></code><!-- /@w --> as functions; without
the parentheses, the interpreter would attempt to evaluate the symbols as
variables.  See <a href="Variables.html">Variables</a>.)
</p>
<p>In spite of the distinction between files and buffers, you will often find
that people refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice versa.  Indeed,
most people say, &ldquo;I am editing a file,&rdquo; rather than saying, &ldquo;I am editing
a buffer which I will soon save to a file.&rdquo; It is almost always clear from
context what people mean.  When dealing with computer programs, however, it
is important to keep the distinction in mind, since the computer is not as
smart as a person.
</p>
<span id="index-Buffer_002c-history-of-word"></span>
<p>The word &ldquo;buffer&rdquo;, by the way, comes from the meaning of the word as a
cushion that deadens the force of a collision.  In early computers, a buffer
cushioned the interaction between files and the computer&rsquo;s central
processing unit.  The drums or tapes that held a file and the central
processing unit were pieces of equipment that were very different from each
other, working at their own speeds, in spurts.  The buffer made it possible
for them to work together effectively.  Eventually, the buffer grew from
being an intermediary, a temporary holding place, to being the place where
work is done.  This transformation is rather like that of a small seaport
that grew into a great city: once it was merely the place where cargo was
warehoused temporarily before being loaded onto ships; then it became a
business and cultural center in its own right.
</p>
<p>Not all buffers are associated with files.  For example, a <samp>*scratch*</samp>
buffer does not visit any file.  Similarly, a <samp>*Help*</samp> buffer is not
associated with any file.
</p>
<p>In the old days, when you lacked a <samp>~/.emacs</samp> file and started an Emacs
session by typing the command <code>emacs</code> alone, without naming any files,
Emacs started with the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer visible.  Nowadays, you will
see a splash screen.  You can follow one of the commands suggested on the
splash screen, visit a file, or press <kbd>q</kbd> to quit the splash screen and
reach the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer.
</p>
<p>If you switch to the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer, type <code>(buffer-name)</code>,
position the cursor after it, and then type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> to evaluate the
expression.  The name <code>&quot;*scratch*&quot;</code> will be returned and will appear in
the echo area.  <code>&quot;*scratch*&quot;</code> is the name of the buffer.  When you type
<code>(buffer-file-name)</code> in the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer and evaluate that,
<code>nil</code> will appear in the echo area, just as it does when you evaluate
<code>(buffer-file-name)</code> in Info.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you are in the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer and want the value
returned by an expression to appear in the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer itself
rather than in the echo area, type <kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-x
C-e</kbd>.  This causes the value returned to appear after the expression.  The
buffer will look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(buffer-name)&quot;*scratch*&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>You cannot do this in Info since Info is read-only and it will not allow you
to change the contents of the buffer.  But you can do this in any buffer you
can edit; and when you write code or documentation (such as this book), this
feature is very useful.
