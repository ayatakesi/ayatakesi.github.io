<span id="The-Advantages-of-Narrowing"></span><h3 class="unnumberedsec">The Advantages of Narrowing</h3>

<p>With narrowing, the rest of a buffer is made invisible, as if it weren&rsquo;t
there.  This is an advantage if, for example, you want to replace a word in
one part of a buffer but not in another: you narrow to the part you want and
the replacement is carried out only in that section, not in the rest of the
buffer.  Searches will only work within a narrowed region, not outside of
one, so if you are fixing a part of a document, you can keep yourself from
accidentally finding parts you do not need to fix by narrowing just to the
region you want.  (The key binding for <code>narrow-to-region</code> is <kbd>C-x n
n</kbd>.)
</p>
<p>However, narrowing does make the rest of the buffer invisible, which can
scare people who inadvertently invoke narrowing and think they have deleted
a part of their file.  Moreover, the <code>undo</code> command (which is usually
bound to <kbd>C-x u</kbd>) does not turn off narrowing (nor should it), so people
can become quite desperate if they do not know that they can return the rest
of a buffer to visibility with the <code>widen</code> command.  (The key binding
for <code>widen</code> is <kbd>C-x n w</kbd>.)
</p>
<p>Narrowing is just as useful to the Lisp interpreter as to a human.  Often,
an Emacs Lisp function is designed to work on just part of a buffer; or
conversely, an Emacs Lisp function needs to work on all of a buffer that has
been narrowed.  The <code>what-line</code> function, for example, removes the
narrowing from a buffer, if it has any narrowing and when it has finished
its job, restores the narrowing to what it was.  On the other hand, the
<code>count-lines</code> function uses narrowing to restrict itself to just that
portion of the buffer in which it is interested and then restores the
previous situation.
