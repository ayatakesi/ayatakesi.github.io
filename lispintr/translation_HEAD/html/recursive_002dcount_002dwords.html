<span id="Count-Words-Recursively"></span><h3 class="section">13.2 Count Words Recursively</h3>
<span id="index-Count-words-recursively"></span>
<span id="index-Recursively-counting-words"></span>
<span id="index-Words_002c-counted-recursively"></span>

<p>You can write the function for counting words recursively as well as with a
<code>while</code> loop.  Let&rsquo;s see how this is done.
</p>
<p>First, we need to recognize that the <code>count-words-example</code> function has
three jobs: it sets up the appropriate conditions for counting to occur; it
counts the words in the region; and it sends a message to the user telling
how many words there are.
</p>
<p>If we write a single recursive function to do everything, we will receive a
message for every recursive call.  If the region contains 13 words, we will
receive thirteen messages, one right after the other.  We don&rsquo;t want this!
Instead, we must write two functions to do the job, one of which (the
recursive function) will be used inside of the other.  One function will set
up the conditions and display the message; the other will return the word
count.
</p>
<p>Let us start with the function that causes the message to be displayed.  We
can continue to call this <code>count-words-example</code>.
</p>
<p>This is the function that the user will call.  It will be interactive.
Indeed, it will be similar to our previous versions of this function, except
that it will call <code>recursive-count-words</code> to determine how many words
are in the region.
</p>
<p>We can readily construct a template for this function, based on our previous
versions:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;; <span class="roman">Recursive version; uses regular expression search</span>
(defun count-words-example (beginning end)
  &quot;<var>documentation</var>&hellip;&quot;
  (<var>interactive-expression</var>&hellip;)
</pre><pre class="example">

;;; <span class="roman">1. Set up appropriate conditions.</span>
  (<var>explanatory message</var>)
  (<var>set-up functions</var>&hellip;
</pre><pre class="example">

;;; <span class="roman">2. Count the words.</span>
    <var>recursive call</var>
</pre><pre class="example">

;;; <span class="roman">3. Send a message to the user.</span>
    <var>message providing word count</var>))
</pre></div>

<p>The definition looks straightforward, except that somehow the count returned
by the recursive call must be passed to the message displaying the word
count.  A little thought suggests that this can be done by making use of a
<code>let</code> expression: we can bind a variable in the varlist of a <code>let</code>
expression to the number of words in the region, as returned by the
recursive call; and then the <code>cond</code> expression, using binding, can
display the value to the user.
</p>
<p>Often, one thinks of the binding within a <code>let</code> expression as somehow
secondary to the primary work of a function.  But in this case, what you
might consider the primary job of the function, counting words, is done
within the <code>let</code> expression.
</p>
<p>Using <code>let</code>, the function definition looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun count-words-example (beginning end)
  &quot;Print number of words in the region.&quot;
  (interactive &quot;r&quot;)
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">1. Set up appropriate conditions.</span>
  (message &quot;Counting words in region ... &quot;)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char beginning)
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">2. Count the words.</span>
    (let ((count (recursive-count-words end)))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">3. Send a message to the user.</span>
      (cond ((zerop count)
             (message
              &quot;The region does NOT have any words.&quot;))
            ((= 1 count)
             (message
              &quot;The region has 1 word.&quot;))
            (t
             (message
              &quot;The region has %d words.&quot; count))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Next, we need to write the recursive counting function.
</p>
<p>A recursive function has at least three parts: the do-again-test, the
next-step-expression, and the recursive call.
</p>
<p>The do-again-test determines whether the function will or will not be called
again.  Since we are counting words in a region and can use a function that
moves point forward for every word, the do-again-test can check whether
point is still within the region.  The do-again-test should find the value
of point and determine whether point is before, at, or after the value of
the end of the region.  We can use the <code>point</code> function to locate
point.  Clearly, we must pass the value of the end of the region to the
recursive counting function as an argument.
</p>
<p>In addition, the do-again-test should also test whether the search finds a
word.  If it does not, the function should not call itself again.
</p>
<p>The next-step-expression changes a value so that when the recursive function
is supposed to stop calling itself, it stops.  More precisely, the
next-step-expression changes a value so that at the right time, the
do-again-test stops the recursive function from calling itself again.  In
this case, the next-step-expression can be the expression that moves point
forward, word by word.
</p>
<p>The third part of a recursive function is the recursive call.
</p>
<p>Somewhere, we also need a part that does the work of the function, a part
that does the counting.  A vital part!
</p>
<p>But already, we have an outline of the recursive counting function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun recursive-count-words (region-end)
  &quot;<var>documentation</var>&hellip;&quot;
   <var>do-again-test</var>
   <var>next-step-expression</var>
   <var>recursive call</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>Now we need to fill in the slots.  Let&rsquo;s start with the simplest cases
first: if point is at or beyond the end of the region, there cannot be any
words in the region, so the function should return zero.  Likewise, if the
search fails, there are no words to count, so the function should return
zero.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if point is within the region and the search succeeds,
the function should call itself again.
</p>
<p>Thus, the do-again-test should look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(and (&lt; (point) region-end)
     (re-search-forward &quot;\\w+\\W*&quot; region-end t))
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the search expression is part of the do-again-test&mdash;the function
returns <code>t</code> if its search succeeds and <code>nil</code> if it fails.
(See <a href="Whitespace-Bug.html">The Whitespace Bug in <code>count-words-example</code></a>,
for an explanation of how <code>re-search-forward</code> works.)
</p>
<p>The do-again-test is the true-or-false test of an <code>if</code> clause.
Clearly, if the do-again-test succeeds, the then-part of the <code>if</code>
clause should call the function again; but if it fails, the else-part should
return zero since either point is outside the region or the search failed
because there were no words to find.
</p>
<p>But before considering the recursive call, we need to consider the
next-step-expression.  What is it? Interestingly, it is the search part of
the do-again-test.
</p>
<p>In addition to returning <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code> for the do-again-test,
<code>re-search-forward</code> moves point forward as a side effect of a
successful search.  This is the action that changes the value of point so
that the recursive function stops calling itself when point completes its
movement through the region.  Consequently, the <code>re-search-forward</code>
expression is the next-step-expression.
</p>
<p>In outline, then, the body of the <code>recursive-count-words</code> function
looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(if <var>do-again-test-and-next-step-combined</var>
    ;; <span class="roman">then</span>
    <var>recursive-call-returning-count</var>
  ;; <span class="roman">else</span>
  <var>return-zero</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>How to incorporate the mechanism that counts?
</p>
<p>If you are not used to writing recursive functions, a question like this can
be troublesome.  But it can and should be approached systematically.
</p>
<p>We know that the counting mechanism should be associated in some way with
the recursive call.  Indeed, since the next-step-expression moves point
forward by one word, and since a recursive call is made for each word, the
counting mechanism must be an expression that adds one to the value returned
by a call to <code>recursive-count-words</code>.
</p>
<p>Consider several cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If there are two words in the region, the function should return a value
resulting from adding one to the value returned when it counts the first
word, plus the number returned when it counts the remaining words in the
region, which in this case is one.

</li><li> If there is one word in the region, the function should return a value
resulting from adding one to the value returned when it counts that word,
plus the number returned when it counts the remaining words in the region,
which in this case is zero.

</li><li> If there are no words in the region, the function should return zero.
</li></ul>

<p>From the sketch we can see that the else-part of the <code>if</code> returns zero
for the case of no words.  This means that the then-part of the <code>if</code>
must return a value resulting from adding one to the value returned from a
count of the remaining words.
</p>
<p>The expression will look like this, where <code>1+</code> is a function that adds
one to its argument.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(1+ (recursive-count-words region-end))
</pre></div>

<p>The whole <code>recursive-count-words</code> function will then look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun recursive-count-words (region-end)
  &quot;<var>documentation</var>&hellip;&quot;

;;; <span class="roman">1. do-again-test</span>
  (if (and (&lt; (point) region-end)
           (re-search-forward &quot;\\w+\\W*&quot; region-end t))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">2. then-part: the recursive call</span>
      (1+ (recursive-count-words region-end))

;;; <span class="roman">3. else-part</span>
    0))
</pre></div>

<p>Let&rsquo;s examine how this works:
</p>
<p>If there are no words in the region, the else part of the <code>if</code>
expression is evaluated and consequently the function returns zero.
</p>
<p>If there is one word in the region, the value of point is less than the
value of <code>region-end</code> and the search succeeds.  In this case, the
true-or-false-test of the <code>if</code> expression tests true, and the then-part
of the <code>if</code> expression is evaluated.  The counting expression is
evaluated.  This expression returns a value (which will be the value
returned by the whole function) that is the sum of one added to the value
returned by a recursive call.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the next-step-expression has caused point to jump over the first
(and in this case only) word in the region.  This means that when
<code>(recursive-count-words region-end)</code> is evaluated a second time, as a
result of the recursive call, the value of point will be equal to or greater
than the value of region end.  So this time, <code>recursive-count-words</code>
will return zero.  The zero will be added to one, and the original
evaluation of <code>recursive-count-words</code> will return one plus zero, which
is one, which is the correct amount.
</p>
<p>Clearly, if there are two words in the region, the first call to
<code>recursive-count-words</code> returns one added to the value returned by
calling <code>recursive-count-words</code> on a region containing the remaining
word&mdash;that is, it adds one to one, producing two, which is the correct
amount.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if there are three words in the region, the first call to
<code>recursive-count-words</code> returns one added to the value returned by
calling <code>recursive-count-words</code> on a region containing the remaining
two words&mdash;and so on and so on.
</p>
<p>With full documentation the two functions look like this:
</p>
<p>The recursive function:
</p>
<span id="index-recursive_002dcount_002dwords"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun recursive-count-words (region-end)
  &quot;Number of words between point and REGION-END.&quot;
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">1. do-again-test</span>
  (if (and (&lt; (point) region-end)
           (re-search-forward &quot;\\w+\\W*&quot; region-end t))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">2. then-part: the recursive call</span>
      (1+ (recursive-count-words region-end))

;;; <span class="roman">3. else-part</span>
    0))
</pre></div>

<p>The wrapper:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; <span class="roman">Recursive version</span>
(defun count-words-example (beginning end)
  &quot;Print number of words in the region.
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">Words are defined as at least one word-constituent

</pre><pre class="example">  (interactive &quot;r&quot;)
  (message &quot;Counting words in region ... &quot;)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char beginning)
    (let ((count (recursive-count-words end)))
</pre><pre class="example">      (cond ((zerop count)
             (message
              &quot;The region does NOT have any words.&quot;))
</pre><pre class="example">            ((= 1 count)
             (message &quot;The region has 1 word.&quot;))
            (t
             (message
