<span id="Idle-Timers-1"></span><h3 class="section">38.11 Idle Timers</h3>
<span id="index-idle-timers"></span>

<p>Here is how to set up a timer that runs when Emacs is idle for a certain
length of time.  Aside from how to set them up, idle timers work just like
ordinary timers.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-run_002dwith_002didle_002dtimer">Command: <strong>run-with-idle-timer</strong> <em>secs repeat function &amp;rest args</em></dt>
<dd><p>Set up a timer which runs the next time Emacs is idle for <var>secs</var>
seconds.  The value of <var>secs</var> may be a number or a value of the type
returned by <code>current-idle-time</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>repeat</var> is <code>nil</code>, the timer runs just once, the first time
Emacs remains idle for a long enough time.  More often <var>repeat</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, which means to run the timer <em>each time</em> Emacs remains
idle for <var>secs</var> seconds.
</p>
<p>The function <code>run-with-idle-timer</code> returns a timer value which you can
use in calling <code>cancel-timer</code> (see <a href="Timers.html#Timers">Timers</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<span id="index-idleness"></span>
<p>Emacs becomes <em>idle</em> when it starts waiting for user input, and it
remains idle until the user provides some input.  If a timer is set for five
seconds of idleness, it runs approximately five seconds after Emacs first
becomes idle.  Even if <var>repeat</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this timer will not
run again as long as Emacs remains idle, because the duration of idleness
will continue to increase and will not go down to five seconds again.
</p>
<p>Emacs can do various things while idle: garbage collect, autosave or handle
data from a subprocess.  But these interludes during idleness do not
interfere with idle timers, because they do not reset the clock of idleness
to zero.  An idle timer set for 600 seconds will run when ten minutes have
elapsed since the last user command was finished, even if subprocess output
has been accepted thousands of times within those ten minutes, and even if
there have been garbage collections and autosaves.
</p>
<p>When the user supplies input, Emacs becomes non-idle while executing the
input.  Then it becomes idle again, and all the idle timers that are set up
to repeat will subsequently run another time, one by one.
</p>
<p>Do not write an idle timer function containing a loop which does a certain
amount of processing each time around, and exits when
<code>(input-pending-p)</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  This approach seems very
natural but has two problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li> It blocks out all process output (since Emacs accepts process output only
while waiting).

</li><li> It blocks out any idle timers that ought to run during that time.
</li></ul>

<p>Similarly, do not write an idle timer function that sets up another idle
timer (including the same idle timer) with <var>secs</var> argument less than or
equal to the current idleness time.  Such a timer will run almost
immediately, and continue running again and again, instead of waiting for
the next time Emacs becomes idle.  The correct approach is to reschedule
with an appropriate increment of the current value of the idleness time, as
described below.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-current_002didle_002dtime">Function: <strong>current-idle-time</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If Emacs is idle, this function returns the length of time Emacs has been
idle, as a list of four integers: <code>(<var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var>
<var>microsec</var> <var>picosec</var>)</code>, using the same format as <code>current-time</code>
(see <a href="Time-of-Day.html#Time-of-Day">Time of Day</a>).
</p>
<p>When Emacs is not idle, <code>current-idle-time</code> returns <code>nil</code>.  This
is a convenient way to test whether Emacs is idle.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The main use of <code>current-idle-time</code> is when an idle timer function
wants to &ldquo;take a break&rdquo; for a while.  It can set up another idle timer to
call the same function again, after a few seconds more idleness.  Here&rsquo;s an
example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defvar my-resume-timer nil
  &quot;Timer for `my-timer-function' to reschedule itself, or nil.&quot;)

(defun my-timer-function ()
  ;; <span class="roman">If the user types a command while <code>my-resume-timer</code></span>
  ;; <span class="roman">is active, the next time this function is called from</span>
  ;; <span class="roman">its main idle timer, deactivate <code>my-resume-timer</code>.</span>
  (when my-resume-timer
    (cancel-timer my-resume-timer))
  ...<var>do the work for a while</var>...
  (when <var>taking-a-break</var>
    (setq my-resume-timer
          (run-with-idle-timer
            ;; Compute an idle time <var>break-length</var>
            ;; more than the current value.
            (time-add (current-idle-time)
                      (seconds-to-time <var>break-length</var>))
            nil
            'my-timer-function))))
</pre></div>
