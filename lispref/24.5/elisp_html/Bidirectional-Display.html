<a name="index-bidirectional-display"></a>
<a name="index-right_002dto_002dleft-text"></a>

<p>Emacs can display text written in scripts, such as Arabic, Farsi, and
Hebrew, whose natural ordering for horizontal text display runs from right
to left.  Furthermore, segments of Latin script and digits embedded in
right-to-left text are displayed left-to-right, while segments of
right-to-left script embedded in left-to-right text (e.g., Arabic or Hebrew
text in comments or strings in a program source file) are appropriately
displayed right-to-left.  We call such mixtures of left-to-right and
right-to-left text <em>bidirectional text</em>.  This section describes the
facilities and options for editing and displaying bidirectional text.
</p>
<a name="index-logical-order"></a>
<a name="index-reading-order"></a>
<a name="index-visual-order"></a>
<a name="index-unicode-bidirectional-algorithm"></a>
<a name="index-UBA"></a>
<a name="index-bidirectional-reordering"></a>
<a name="index-reordering_002c-of-bidirectional-text"></a>
<p>Text is stored in Emacs buffers and strings in <em>logical</em> (or
<em>reading</em>) order, i.e., the order in which a human would read each
character.  In right-to-left and bidirectional text, the order in which
characters are displayed on the screen (called <em>visual order</em>) is not
the same as logical order; the characters&rsquo; screen positions do not increase
monotonically with string or buffer position.  In performing this
<em>bidirectional reordering</em>, Emacs follows the Unicode Bidirectional
Algorithm (a.k.a. <acronym>UBA</acronym>), which is described in Annex #9 of the
Unicode standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/</a>).  Emacs
currently provides a &ldquo;Non-isolate Bidirectionality&rdquo; class implementation
of the <acronym>UBA</acronym>: it does not yet support the isolate directional
formatting characters introduced with Unicode Standard v6.3.0.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering"></a>Variable: <strong>bidi-display-reordering</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If the value of this buffer-local variable is non-<code>nil</code> (the default),
Emacs performs bidirectional reordering for display.  The reordering affects
buffer text, as well as display strings and overlay strings from text and
overlay properties in the buffer (see <a href="Overlay-Properties.html#Overlay-Properties">Overlay Properties</a>, and
see <a href="Display-Property.html#Display-Property">Display Property</a>).  If the value is <code>nil</code>, Emacs does not
perform bidirectional reordering in the buffer.
</p>
<p>The default value of <code>bidi-display-reordering</code> controls the reordering
of strings which are not directly supplied by a buffer, including the text
displayed in mode lines (see <a href="Mode-Line-Format.html#Mode-Line-Format">Mode Line Format</a>)  and header lines
(see <a href="Header-Lines.html#Header-Lines">Header Lines</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-unibyte-buffers_002c-and-bidi-reordering"></a>
<p>Emacs never reorders the text of a unibyte buffer, even if
<code>bidi-display-reordering</code> is non-<code>nil</code> in the buffer.  This is
because unibyte buffers contain raw bytes, not characters, and thus lack the
directionality properties required for reordering.  Therefore, to test
whether text in a buffer will be reordered for display, it is not enough to
test the value of <code>bidi-display-reordering</code> alone.  The correct test is
this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"> (if (and enable-multibyte-characters
          bidi-display-reordering)
     ;; Buffer is being reordered for display
   )
</pre></div>

<p>However, unibyte display and overlay strings <em>are</em> reordered if their
parent buffer is reordered.  This is because plain-<small>ASCII</small> strings are
stored by Emacs as unibyte strings.  If a unibyte display or overlay string
includes non-<small>ASCII</small> characters, these characters are assumed to have
left-to-right direction.
</p>
<a name="index-display-properties_002c-and-bidi-reordering-of-text"></a>
<p>Text covered by <code>display</code> text properties, by overlays with
<code>display</code> properties whose value is a string, and by any other
properties that replace buffer text, is treated as a single unit when it is
reordered for display.  That is, the entire chunk of text covered by these
properties is reordered together.  Moreover, the bidirectional properties of
the characters in such a chunk of text are ignored, and Emacs reorders them
as if they were replaced with a single character <code>U+FFFC</code>, known as the
<em>Object Replacement Character</em>.  This means that placing a display
property over a portion of text may change the way that the surrounding text
is reordered for display.  To prevent this unexpected effect, always place
such properties on text whose directionality is identical with text that
surrounds it.
</p>
<a name="index-base-direction-of-a-paragraph"></a>
<p>Each paragraph of bidirectional text has a <em>base direction</em>, either
right-to-left or left-to-right.  Left-to-right paragraphs are displayed
beginning at the left margin of the window, and are truncated or continued
when the text reaches the right margin.  Right-to-left paragraphs are
displayed beginning at the right margin, and are continued or truncated at
the left margin.
</p>
<p>By default, Emacs determines the base direction of each paragraph by looking
at the text at its beginning.  The precise method of determining the base
direction is specified by the <acronym>UBA</acronym>; in a nutshell, the first
character in a paragraph that has an explicit directionality determines the
base direction of the paragraph.  However, sometimes a buffer may need to
force a certain base direction for its paragraphs.  For example, buffers
containing program source code should force all paragraphs to be displayed
left-to-right.  You can use following variable to do this:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>Variable: <strong>bidi-paragraph-direction</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If the value of this buffer-local variable is the symbol
<code>right-to-left</code> or <code>left-to-right</code>, all paragraphs in the buffer
are assumed to have that specified direction.  Any other value is equivalent
to <code>nil</code> (the default), which means to determine the base direction of
each paragraph from its contents.
</p>
<a name="index-prog_002dmode_002c-and-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>
<p>Modes for program source code should set this to <code>left-to-right</code>.  Prog
mode does this by default, so modes derived from Prog mode do not need to
set this explicitly (see <a href="Basic-Major-Modes.html#Basic-Major-Modes">Basic Major Modes</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-current_002dbidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>Function: <strong>current-bidi-paragraph-direction</strong> <em>&amp;optional buffer</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the paragraph direction at point in the named
<var>buffer</var>.  The returned value is a symbol, either <code>left-to-right</code>
or <code>right-to-left</code>.  If <var>buffer</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it
defaults to the current buffer.  If the buffer-local value of the variable
<code>bidi-paragraph-direction</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the returned value will
be identical to that value; otherwise, the returned value reflects the
paragraph direction determined dynamically by Emacs.  For buffers whose
value of <code>bidi-display-reordering</code> is <code>nil</code> as well as unibyte
buffers, this function always returns <code>left-to-right</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-visual_002dorder-cursor-motion"></a>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a need to move point in strict visual order, either to the
left or to the right of its current screen position.  Emacs provides a
primitive to do that.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-move_002dpoint_002dvisually"></a>Function: <strong>move-point-visually</strong> <em>direction</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function moves point of the currently selected window to the buffer
position that appears immediately to the right or to the left of point on
the screen.  If <var>direction</var> is positive, point will move one screen
position to the right, otherwise it will move one screen position to the
left.  Note that, depending on the surrounding bidirectional context, this
could potentially move point many buffer positions away.  If invoked at the
end of a screen line, the function moves point to the rightmost or leftmost
screen position of the next or previous screen line, as appropriate for the
value of <var>direction</var>.
</p>
<p>The function returns the new buffer position as its value.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-layout-on-display_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
<a name="index-jumbled-display-of-bidirectional-text"></a>
<a name="index-concatenating-bidirectional-strings"></a>
<p>Bidirectional reordering can have surprising and unpleasant effects when two
strings with bidirectional content are juxtaposed in a buffer, or otherwise
programmatically concatenated into a string of text.  A typical problematic
case is when a buffer consists of sequences of text &ldquo;fields&rdquo; separated by
whitespace or punctuation characters, like Buffer Menu mode or Rmail Summary
Mode.  Because the punctuation characters used as separators have <em>weak
directionality</em>, they take on the directionality of surrounding text.  As
result, a numeric field that follows a field with bidirectional content can
be displayed <em>to the left</em> of the preceding field, messing up the
expected layout.  There are several ways to avoid this problem:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- Append the special character <code>U+200E</code>, LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK, or
<acronym>LRM</acronym>, to the end of each field that may have bidirectional content,
or prepend it to the beginning of the following field.  The function
<code>bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</code>, described below, comes in handy for
this purpose.  (In a right-to-left paragraph, use <code>U+200F</code>,
RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK, or <acronym>RLM</acronym>, instead.)  This is one of the
solutions recommended by the UBA.

</li><li>- Include the tab character in the field separator.  The tab character plays
the role of <em>segment separator</em> in bidirectional reordering, causing the
text on either side to be reordered separately.

</li><li>- <a name="index-space-display-spec_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
Separate fields with a <code>display</code> property or overlay with a property
value of the form <code>(space . PROPS)</code> (see <a href="Specified-Space.html#Specified-Space">Specified Space</a>).  Emacs
treats this display specification as a <em>paragraph separator</em>, and
reorders the text on either side separately.
</li></ul>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-bidi_002dstring_002dmark_002dleft_002dto_002dright"></a>Function: <strong>bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</strong> <em>string</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns its argument <var>string</var>, possibly modified, such
that the result can be safely concatenated with another string, or
juxtaposed with another string in a buffer, without disrupting the relative
layout of this string and the next one on display.  If the string returned
by this function is displayed as part of a left-to-right paragraph, it will
always appear on display to the left of the text that follows it.  The
function works by examining the characters of its argument, and if any of
those characters could cause reordering on display, the function appends the
<acronym>LRM</acronym> character to the string.  The appended <acronym>LRM</acronym> character
is made invisible by giving it an <code>invisible</code> text property of <code>t</code>
(see <a href="Invisible-Text.html#Invisible-Text">Invisible Text</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The reordering algorithm uses the bidirectional properties of the characters
stored as their <code>bidi-class</code> property (see <a href="Character-Properties.html#Character-Properties">Character Properties</a>).
Lisp programs can change these properties by calling the
<code>put-char-code-property</code> function.  However, doing this requires a
thorough understanding of the <acronym>UBA</acronym>, and is therefore not
recommended.  Any changes to the bidirectional properties of a character
have global effect: they affect all Emacs frames and windows.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>mirroring</code> property is used to display the appropriate
mirrored character in the reordered text.  Lisp programs can affect the
mirrored display by changing this property.  Again, any such changes affect
all of Emacs display.
