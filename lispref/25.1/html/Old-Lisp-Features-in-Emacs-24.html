<h3 class="section">A.1 Old Lisp Features in Emacs 24</h3>

<ul>
<li> The requirement that <code>setq</code> and <code>setf</code> must be called with an even
number of arguments has been removed.  You can now call them with an odd
number of arguments, and Emacs will helpfully supply a <code>nil</code> for the
missing one.  Simplicity rules!

</li><li> <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> and <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> set the <code>EMACS</code> environment
variable, as they should, to indicate that the subprocess is run by Emacs.
This is so packages that took years to learn how to work around that setting
could continue using their code to that effect.

</li><li> The <code>save-excursion</code> form saves and restores the mark, as expected.  No
more need for the new <code>save-mark-and-excursion</code>, which has been
deleted.

</li><li> We have removed the <code>text-quoting-style</code> variable and the associated
functionality that translates quote characters in messages displayed to the
user and in help buffers.  Emacs now shows exactly the same quote characters
as you wrote in your code! Likewise, <code>substitute-command-keys</code> leaves
the quote characters alone.  As you move back in time, Unicode support
becomes less and less important, so no need to display those fancy new
quotes the Unicode Standard invented.

</li><li> Regular expressions have been simplified by removing support for Unicode
character properties in regexp classes.  As result, <code>[:alpha:]</code> and
<code>[:alnum:]</code> will match any character with a word syntax, and
<code>[:graph:]</code> and <code>[:print:]</code> will match any multibyte character,
including surrogates and unassigned codepoints.  Once again, this is in line
with diminishing importance of Unicode as you move back in time.

</li><li> Evaluating &lsquo;<samp>(/ <var>n</var>)</samp>&rsquo; will now yield <var>n</var>.  We have realized that
interpreting that as in Common Lisp was a bad mistake that needed to be
corrected.

</li><li> The <code>pcase</code> form was significantly simplified by removing the UPatterns
<code>quote</code> and <code>app</code>.  To further simplify this facility, we&rsquo;ve
removed <code>pcase-defmacro</code>, since we found no need for letting Lisp
programs define new UPatterns.

</li><li> We&rsquo;ve removed the text properties <code>cursor-intangible</code> and
<code>cursor-sensor-functions</code>, replacing them by the much simpler
<code>intangible</code>, <code>point-entered</code>, and <code>point-left</code> properties.
The latter are implemented on a much lower level, and therefore are better
integrated with user expectations.  For similar reasons,
<code>cursor-intangible-mode</code> and <code>cursor-sensor-mode</code> were removed;
use the hook variable <code>inhibit-point-motion-hooks</code> which is no longer
obsolete.

</li><li> Process creation and management functions were significantly improved and
simplified by removing <code>make-process</code> and the <code>pipe</code> connection
type.  Redirecting <code>stderr</code> of a subprocess should be done with shell
facilities, not by Emacs.

</li><li> We decided that shutting up informative messages is bad for user
interaction, so we&rsquo;ve removed the <code>inhibit-message</code> variable which
could be used to that effect.

</li><li> Support for generators and for finalizers has been removed, as we found no
real need for these facilities.

</li><li> Due to excessive complexity and the diminishing need for Unicode support,
the functions <code>string-collate-lessp</code> and <code>string-collate-equalp</code>
were removed.  Their locale-independent counterparts <code>string-lessp</code> and
<code>string-equal</code> are so much more simple and yield predictable results
that we don&rsquo;t see any situation where the locale-dependent collation could
be useful in Emacs.  As result, the <samp>ls-lisp.el</samp> package sorts files in
a locale-independent manner.

</li><li> In preparation for removal in some past version of Emacs of the
bidirectional editing support, we started by deleting two functions
<code>bidi-find-overridden-directionality</code> and
<code>buffer-substring-with-bidi-context</code>.

</li><li> Time conversion functions, such as <code>current-time-string</code>, no longer
accept an optional <var>zone</var> argument.  If you need to change the current
time zone (why?), do that explicitly with <code>set-time-zone-rule</code>.

</li><li> 簡略化にたいする継続要求の一環として、他の多くの関数と変数が排除されました。
</li></ul>
