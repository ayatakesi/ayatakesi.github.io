<span id="index-security"></span>
<span id="index-hardening"></span>

<p>Like any application, Emacs can be run in a secure environment, where the
operating system enforces rules about access and the like.  With some care,
Emacs-based applications can also be part of a security perimeter that
checks such rules.  Although the default settings for Emacs work well for a
typical software development environment, they may require adjustment in
environments containing untrusted users that may include attackers.  Here is
a compendium of security issues that may be helpful if you are developing
such applications.  It is by no means complete; it is intended to give you
an idea of the security issues involved, rather than to be a security
checklist.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>File local variables</dt>
<dd><span id="index-file-local-variables-1"></span>
<p>A file that Emacs visits can contain variable settings that affects the
buffer visiting that file; See section <a href="File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables">ファイルローカル変数</a>.  Similarly, a
directory can specify local variable values common to all files in that
directory; See section <a href="Directory-Local-Variables.html#Directory-Local-Variables">ディレクトリーローカル変数</a>.  Although Emacs takes some
effort to protect against misuse of these variables, a security hole can be
created merely by a package setting <code>safe-local-variable</code> too
optimistically, a problem that is all too common.  To disable this feature
for both files and directories, set <code>enable-local-variables</code> to
<code>nil</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Access control</dt>
<dd><p>Although Emacs normally respects access permissions of the underlying
operating system, in some cases it handles accesses specially.  For example,
file names can have handlers that treat the files specially, with their own
access checking.  See section <a href="Magic-File-Names.html#Magic-File-Names">特定のファイル名の&ldquo;Magic&rdquo;の作成</a>.  Also, a buffer can be read-only
even if the corresponding file is writeable, and vice versa, which can
result in messages such as &lsquo;<samp>File passwd is write-protected; try to save
anyway? (yes or no)</samp>&rsquo;.  See section <a href="Read-Only-Buffers.html#Read-Only-Buffers">読み取り専用のバッファー</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Authentication</dt>
<dd><p>Emacs has several functions that deal with passwords, e.g.,
<code>read-passwd</code>.  See section <a href="Reading-a-Password.html#Reading-a-Password">パスワードの読み取り</a>.  Although these functions do
not attempt to broadcast passwords to the world, their implementations are
not proof against determined attackers with access to Emacs internals.  For
example, even if Elisp code uses <code>clear-string</code> to scrub a password
from its memory after using it, remnants of the password may still reside in
the garbage-collected free list.  See section <a href="Modifying-Strings.html#Modifying-Strings">文字列の変更</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Code injection</dt>
<dd><p>Emacs can send commands to many other applications, and applications should
take care that strings sent as operands of these commands are not
misinterpreted as directives.  For example, when using a shell command to
rename a file <var>a</var> to <var>b</var>, do not simply use the string <code>mv
<var>a</var> <var>b</var></code>, because either file name might start with &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;, or
might contain shell metacharacters like &lsquo;<samp>;</samp>&rsquo;.  Although functions like
<code>shell-quote-argument</code> can help avoid this sort of problem, they are
not panaceas; for example, on a POSIX platform <code>shell-quote-argument</code>
quotes shell metacharacters but not leading &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;.  See section <a href="Shell-Arguments.html#Shell-Arguments">shell引数</a>.  Typically it is safer to use <code>call-process</code> than a
subshell.  See section <a href="Synchronous-Processes.html#Synchronous-Processes">同期プロセスの作成</a>.  And it is safer yet to use builtin
Emacs functions; for example, use <code>(rename-file &quot;<var>a</var>&quot; &quot;<var>b</var>&quot; t)</code>
instead of invoking <code>mv</code>.  See section <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">ファイルの名前と属性の変更</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Coding systems</dt>
<dd><p>Emacs attempts to infer the coding systems of the files and network
connections it accesses.  See section <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">コーディングシステム</a>.  If Emacs infers
incorrectly, or if the other parties to the network connection disagree with
Emacs&rsquo;s inferences, the resulting system could be unreliable.  Also, even
when it infers correctly, Emacs often can use bytes that other programs
cannot.  For example, although to Emacs the null byte is just a character
like any other, many other applications treat it as a string terminator and
mishandle strings or files containing null bytes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Environment and configuration variables</dt>
<dd><p>POSIX specifies several environment variables that can affect how Emacs
behaves.  Any environment variable whose name consists entirely of uppercase
ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore may affect the internal behavior
of Emacs.  Emacs uses several such variables, e.g., <code>EMACSLOADPATH</code>.
See section <a href="Library-Search.html#Library-Search">ライブラリー検索</a>.  On some platforms some environment variables (e.g.,
<code>PATH</code>, <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code>, <code>SHELL</code>, <code>TMPDIR</code>) need to have
properly-configured values in order to get standard behavior for any utility
Emacs might invoke.  Even seemingly-benign variables like <code>TZ</code> may have
security implications.  See section <a href="System-Environment.html#System-Environment">オペレーティングシステムの環境</a>.
</p>
<p>Emacs has customization and other variables with similar considerations.
For example, if the variable <code>shell-file-name</code> specifies a shell with
nonstandard behavior, an Emacs-based application may misbehave.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Installation</dt>
<dd><p>When Emacs is installed, if the installation directory hierarchy can be
modified by untrusted users, the application cannot be trusted.  This
applies also to the directory hierarchies of the programs that Emacs uses,
and of the files that Emacs reads and writes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Network access</dt>
<dd><p>Emacs often accesses the network, and you may want to configure it to avoid
network accesses that it would normally do.  For example, unless you set
<code>tramp-mode</code> to <code>nil</code>, file names using a certain syntax are
interpreted as being network files, and are retrieved across the network.
See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/index.html#Top">The Tramp Manual</a> in <cite>The Tramp Manual</cite>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Race conditions</dt>
<dd><p>Emacs applications have the same sort of race-condition issues that other
applications do.  For example, even when <code>(file-readable-p &quot;foo.txt&quot;)</code>
returns <code>t</code>, it could be that <samp>foo.txt</samp> is unreadable because some
other program changed the file&rsquo;s permissions between the call to
<code>file-readable-p</code> and now.  See section <a href="Testing-Accessibility.html#Testing-Accessibility">アクセシビリティのテスト</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Resource limits</dt>
<dd><p>When Emacs exhausts memory or other operating system resources, its behavior
can be less reliable, in that computations that ordinarily run to completion
may abort back to the top level.  This may cause Emacs to neglect operations
that it normally would have done.
