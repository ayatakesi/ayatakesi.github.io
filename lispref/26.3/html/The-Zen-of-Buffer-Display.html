<span id="index-buffer-display-conventions"></span>

<p>In its most simplistic form, a frame accommodates always one single window
that can be used for displaying a buffer.  As a consequence, it is always
the latest call of <code>display-buffer</code> that will have succeeded in placing
its buffer there.
</p>
<p>Since working with such a frame is not very practical, Emacs by default
allows for more complex frame layouts controlled by the default values of
the frame size and the <code>split-height-threshold</code> and
<code>split-width-threshold</code> options.  Displaying a buffer not yet shown on
a frame then either splits the single window on that frame or (re-)uses one
of its two windows.
</p>
<p>The default behavior is abandoned as soon as the user customizes one of
these thresholds or manually changes the frame&rsquo;s layout.  The default
behavior is also abandoned when calling <code>display-buffer</code> with a
non-<code>nil</code> <var>action</var> argument or the user customizes one of the
options mentioned in the previous subsections.  Mastering
<code>display-buffer</code> soon may become a frustrating experience due to the
plethora of applicable display actions and the resulting frame layouts.
</p>
<p>However, refraining from using buffer display functions and falling back on
a split &amp; delete windows metaphor is not a good idea either.  Buffer display
functions give Lisp programs and users a framework to reconcile their
different needs; no comparable framework exists for splitting and deleting
windows.  Buffer display functions also allow to at least partially restore
the layout of a frame when removing a buffer from it later (see <a href="Quitting-Windows.html#Quitting-Windows">Quitting Windows</a>).
</p>
<p>Below we will give a number of guidelines to redeem the frustration
mentioned above and thus to avoid literally losing buffers in-between the
windows of a frame.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>Write display actions without stress</dt>
<dd><p>Writing display actions can be a pain because one has to lump together
action functions and action alists in one huge list.  (Historical reasons
prevented us from having <code>display-buffer</code> support separate arguments
for these.)  It might help to memorize some basic forms like the ones listed
below:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">'(nil (inhibit-same-window . t))
</pre></div>

<p>specifies an action alist entry only and no action function.  Its sole
purpose is to inhibit a <code>display-buffer-same-window</code> function specified
elsewhere from showing the buffer in the same window, see also the last
example of the preceding subsection.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">'(display-buffer-below-selected)
</pre></div>

<p>on the other hand, specifies one action function and an empty action alist.
To combine the effects of the above two specifications one would write the
form
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">'(display-buffer-below-selected (inhibit-same-window . t))
</pre></div>

<p>to add another action function one would write
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">'((display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
  (inhibit-same-window . t))
</pre></div>

<p>and to add another alist entry one would write
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">'((display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
  (inhibit-same-window . t)
  (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))
</pre></div>

<p>That last form can be used as <var>action</var> argument of <code>display-buffer</code>
in the following way:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(display-buffer
 (get-buffer-create &quot;*foo*&quot;)
 '((display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
   (inhibit-same-window . t)
   (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer)))
</pre></div>

<p>In a customization of <code>display-buffer-alist</code> it would be used as
follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(customize-set-variable
 'display-buffer-alist
 '((&quot;\\*foo\\*&quot;
    (display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
    (inhibit-same-window . t)
    (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))))
</pre></div>

<p>To add a customization for a second buffer one would then write:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(customize-set-variable
 'display-buffer-alist
 '((&quot;\\*foo\\*&quot;
    (display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
    (inhibit-same-window . t)
    (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))
   (&quot;\\*bar\\*&quot;
    (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
    (reusable-frames . visible))))
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt>Treat each other with respect</dt>
<dd><p><code>display-buffer-alist</code> and <code>display-buffer-base-action</code> are user
options&mdash;Lisp programs must never set or rebind them.
<code>display-buffer-overriding-action</code>, on the other hand, is reserved for
applications&mdash;who seldom use that option and if they use it, then with
utmost care.
</p>
<p>Older implementations of <code>display-buffer</code> frequently caused users and
applications to fight over the settings of user options like
<code>pop-up-frames</code> and <code>pop-up-windows</code> (see <a href="Choosing-Window-Options.html#Choosing-Window-Options">Choosing Window Options</a>).  This was one major reason for redesigning
<code>display-buffer</code>&mdash;to provide a clear framework specifying what users
and applications should be allowed to do.
</p>
<p>Lisp programs must be prepared that user customizations may cause buffers to
get displayed in an unexpected way.  They should never assume in their
subsequent behavior, that the buffer has been shown precisely the way they
asked for in the <var>action</var> argument of <code>display-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>Users should not pose too many and too severe restrictions on how arbitrary
buffers get displayed.  Otherwise, they will risk to lose the
characteristics of showing a buffer for a certain purpose.  Suppose a Lisp
program has been written to compare different versions of a buffer in two
windows side-by-side.  If the customization of <code>display-buffer-alist</code>
prescribes that any such buffer should be always shown in or below the
selected window, the program will have a hard time to set up the desired
window configuration via <code>display-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>To specify a preference for showing an arbitrary buffer, users should
customize <code>display-buffer-base-action</code>.  An example of how users who
prefer working with multiple frames would do that was given in the previous
subsection.  <code>display-buffer-alist</code> should be reserved for displaying
specific buffers in a specific way.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Consider reusing a window that already shows the buffer</dt>
<dd><p>Generally, it&rsquo;s always a good idea for users and Lisp programmers to be
prepared for the case that a window already shows the buffer in question and
to reuse that window.  In the preceding subsection we have shown that
failing to do so properly may cause <code>display-buffer</code> to continuously
pop up a new frame although a frame showing that buffer existed already.  In
a few cases only, it might be undesirable to reuse a window, for example,
when a different portion of the buffer should be shown in that window.
</p>
<p>Hence, <code>display-buffer-reuse-window</code> is one action function that should
be used as often as possible, both in <var>action</var> arguments and
customizations.  An <code>inhibit-same-window</code> entry in the <var>action</var>
argument usually takes care of the most common case where reusing a window
showing the buffer should be avoided&mdash;that where the window in question is
the selected one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attract focus to the window chosen</dt>
<dd><p>This is a no-brainer for people working with multiple frames&mdash;the frame
showing the buffer will automatically raise and get focus unless an
<code>inhibit-switch-frame</code> entry forbids it.  For single frame users this
task can be considerably more difficult.  In particular,
<code>display-buffer-pop-up-window</code> and
<code>display-buffer-use-some-window</code> can become obtrusive in this regard.
They split or use a seemingly arbitrary (often the largest or least recently
used) window, distracting the user&rsquo;s attention.
</p>
<p>Some Lisp programs therefore try to choose a window at the bottom of the
frame, for example, in order to display the buffer in vicinity of the
minibuffer window where the user is expected to answer a question related to
the new window.  For non-input related actions
<code>display-buffer-below-selected</code> might be preferable because the
selected window usually already has the user&rsquo;s attention.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Handle subsequent invocations of <code>display-buffer</code></dt>
<dd><p><code>display-buffer</code> is not overly well suited for displaying several
buffers in sequence and making sure that all these buffers are shown orderly
in the resulting window configuration.  Again, the standard action functions
<code>display-buffer-pop-up-window</code> and
<code>display-buffer-use-some-window</code> are not very suited for this purpose
due to their somewhat chaotic nature in more complex configurations.
</p>
<p>To produce a window configuration displaying multiple buffers (or different
views of one and the same buffer) in one and the same display cycle, Lisp
programmers will unavoidably have to write their own action functions.  A
few tricks listed below might help in this regard.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Making windows atomic (see <a href="Atomic-Windows.html#Atomic-Windows">Atomic Windows</a>) avoids breaking an existing
window composition when popping up a new window.  The new window will pop up
outside the composition instead.

</li><li> Temporarily dedicating windows to their buffers (see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>)
avoids using a window for displaying a different buffer.  A non-dedicated
window will be used instead.

</li><li> Calling <code>window-preserve-size</code> (see <a href="Preserving-Window-Sizes.html#Preserving-Window-Sizes">Preserving Window Sizes</a>)  will
try to keep the size of the argument window unchanged when popping up a new
window.  You have to make sure that another window in the same combination
can be shrunk instead, though.

</li><li> Side windows (see <a href="Side-Windows.html#Side-Windows">Side Windows</a>) can be used for displaying specific
buffers always in a window at the same position of a frame.  This permits
grouping buffers that do not compete for being shown at the same time on a
frame and showing any such buffer in the same window without disrupting the
display of other buffers.

</li><li> Child frames (see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>) can be used to display a buffer within
the screen estate of the selected frame without disrupting that frame&rsquo;s
window configuration and without the overhead associated with full-fledged
frames as inflicted by <code>display-buffer-pop-up-frame</code>.
</li></ul>
