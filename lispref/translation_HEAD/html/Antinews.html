<span id="Emacs-28-Antinews"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Emacs 28 Antinews</h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 28.2.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;27.1<!-- /@w -->
features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The implementation of overlays is back to its simple, time-proven storage in
a pair of linear linked lists centered around some buffer position.  No more
fancy interval trees and suchlikes.  Lisp programs that use overlays once
again need to recenter overlays around the buffer position of interest, and
display-related features should again make sure they don&rsquo;t use too many
overlays in a buffer, lest redisplay will be too slow.

</li><li> Several functions stopped the annoying conversion of quotes and key
sequences by no longer calling <code>substitute-command-keys</code>.  One
prominent example is <code>format-prompt</code> and all its many callers.  This
makes the strings they produce much more predictable, returning to you, the
Lisp programmer, control on which punctuation characters will appear in the
text presented to the users.  For similar reasons, the
<code>substitute-quotes</code> function was deleted.

</li><li> The venerable <code>buffer-modified-p</code> function again reliably returns
either <code>nil</code> or <code>t</code>, not any other confusing values.

</li><li> The support for &lsquo;<samp>medium</samp>&rsquo; weight of fonts was dropped.  Emacs now
considers &lsquo;<samp>medium</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>regular</samp>&rsquo; weights to be the same.  We
believe this will simplify your font setup, since there&rsquo;s no longer a need
to worry about fonts that support &lsquo;<samp>regular</samp>&rsquo; weight, but not the
&lsquo;<samp>medium</samp>&rsquo; one, or vice versa: either one will do!

</li><li> To reduce the amount of code in Emacs related to unimportant features, we&rsquo;ve
removed the function <code>compiled-function-p</code>.  Lisp programs are expected
to test explicitly for the relevant types of function objects: built-in,
byte-compiled, and natively-compiled.  For the same reasons we deleted the
functions <code>pos-bol</code>, <code>pos-eol</code>,
<code>file-attribute-file-identifier</code>, and quite a few others.  We don&rsquo;t
expect anyone to miss those fancy functions.

</li><li> The timeout used by <code>x-show-tip</code> can no longer be specified by Lisp
programs; it is hard-coded in the function.  This will lead to a simpler,
easier maintained code, and no one should want to control the timeout after
which the tip pops down.

</li><li> The macro <code>setopt</code> was deleted; use <code>customize-variable</code> instead,
or invoke the <code>:set</code> function from Lisp.

</li><li> We removed the <code>lisp-directory</code> variable, as the value can be easily
deduced from other similar variables, like <code>installation-directory</code> and
<code>source-directory</code>, each one when it&rsquo;s relevant.

</li><li> To simplify code and reduce complexity, we deleted the functions
<code>get-display-property</code> and <code>add-display-text-property</code>; use the
generic <code>get-text-property</code> and <code>put-text-property</code> instead.

</li><li> Support for pinch input events and for modern drag-and-drop functionality on
X was dropped.  As you move back in time, these facilities will become less
and less important, and will soon enough disappear, so there&rsquo;s no reason to
keep them in Emacs.

</li><li> To keep Emacs clean and elegant, we&rsquo;ve removed the <samp>textsec.el</samp>
library, with its facilities for checking whether some text is
&ldquo;suspicious&rdquo;.  We consider our users smart enough to detect maliciously
modified text by just looking at it or by moving the cursor across it, and
the whole idea that someone would wish to deliberately deceive Emacs users
ridiculous and unworthy of complicating our elegant text-processing and
display capabilities.

</li><li> The functions <code>keymap-set</code>, <code>keymap-global-set</code>,
<code>keymap-local-set</code>, <code>keymap-substitute</code>, <code>keymap-lookup</code>, and
some others were deleted.  We have found the traditional <code>define-key</code>,
<code>global-set-key</code>, <code>local-set-key</code>,
<code>substitute-key-definition</code>, and <code>key-binding</code> more than enough,
and their minor inconsistencies in the syntax of keys they accept a source
of endless fun in Emacs Lisp programming.  Why make Emacs programming a dull
place? For the same reasons we deleted <code>key-valid-p</code>, since we consider
the permissive nature of <code>kbd</code> more in the spirit of Emacs Lisp.

</li><li> Yanking of anything but plain text from other applications becomes more and
more an unnecessary feature as you move back in time, so we dropped support
for pasting media like HTML and images via the clipboard.  If you <i>really</i>
need to yank those into an Emacs buffer, you can go via a disk file.

</li><li> We removed unnecessary functions <code>string-pixel-width</code> and
<code>string-glyph-split</code>, as we consider it inappropriate for Lisp programs
to do display layout calculations, where these functions come in handy.
Display is for the display engine, written in C, and should stay there!

</li><li> Various new Xwidget functions, such as <code>xwidget-perform-lispy-event</code>,
<code>xwidget-webkit-load-html</code>, and
<code>xwidget-webkit-back-forward-list</code>, were deleted as part of our
continuing effort to gradually delete the entire Xwidget functionality in
some previous release of Emacs.

</li><li> Setting the <code>:stderr</code> property of a process in a <code>make-process</code>
call once again forces the process&rsquo;s connection to use pipes, not ptys, for
all the standard streams &mdash; a considerable simplification of this complex
interface.

</li><li> To keep the amount of Lisp functions from growing out of control, we deleted
<code>string-equal-ignore-case</code>.  Use <code>compare-strings</code> instead.

<p>バイトコンパイラーを複雑にするいくつかの機能を削除しました。
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- The warnings about quoting mistakes in documentation strings.  You are
expected to find such mistakes yourself, by eyeballing the resulting
<samp>*Help*</samp> buffer display.

</li><li>- The warnings about malformed <code>defcustom</code> types, like double-quoting
symbols in <code>choice</code> lists.
</li></ul>

</li><li> The macro <code>with-buffer-unmodified-if-unchanged</code> was deleted.  Lisp
programs that need to leave the buffer unmodified in these cases can always
compare the text before and after the modifications.

</li><li> The functions <code>string-edit</code> and <code>read-string-from-buffer</code> were
removed, as we consider the fun of programming them anew every time an
important part of the education of each Emacs Lisp developer.

</li><li> We deleted the function <code>readablep</code> and the related variable
<code>print-unreadable-function</code>, since no one is supposed to want to print
unreadable Lisp objects.

</li><li> The facility for storing multisession variables was deleted as an
unnecessary complication.  With it are gone <code>multisession-value</code>,
<code>define-multisession-variable</code>, and <code>list-multisession-values</code>.

</li><li> The support for the <code>cursor-face</code> text property was dropped.  We
consider the rest of the faces adequate for supporting this functionality.

</li><li> The function <code>tooltip-show</code> dropped support for optional face arguments
<code>text-face</code> and <code>default-face</code> that allow fancy control of the
face of the tip text and top frame colors.  We decided that tooltips should
all look the same, to prevent user confusion.

</li><li> As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other functions and
variables have been eliminated.  Other functions and variables, that were
declared obsolete since Emacs 24, have been added back, in preparation for
releasing Emacs 24 in some distant past.
</li></ul>
