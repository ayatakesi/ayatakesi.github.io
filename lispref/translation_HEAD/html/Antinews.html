<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Emacs 27 Antinews</h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 27.2.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;27.1<!-- /@w -->
features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The annoying <code>lexical-binding</code> local variable now heeds the value of
<code>enable-local-variables</code>: if it&rsquo;s <code>nil</code>, the
<code>lexical-binding</code> cookie is ignored.  We are working hard on removing
the lexical-binding support in some past Emacs version, and this small step
advances us back to that change.

</li><li> The <code>load-dangerous-libraries</code> variable is not obsolete, as it must be
used to allow loading Lisp compiled by XEmacs, which will become more and
more important as you move back in time.

</li><li> The optional <var>modes</var> argument of <code>interactive</code> is not supported,
and every command is deemed applicable to any major mode.  We believe this
makes the life of Lisp programmers much simpler, as there&rsquo;s now no need to
tag commands with the modes where they make sense.

</li><li> Shorthands for Lisp symbols have been removed, which makes loading Lisp
files and handling Lisp symbols much simpler and more efficient.  This is
important for decent performance on slower CPUs as you move back in time.

</li><li> To reduce the amount of code in Emacs related to unimportant features, we&rsquo;ve
removed the variables <code>global-minor-modes</code> and
<code>local-minor-modes</code>.  If your Lisp program needs to determine whether
some minor mode is in effect, it will have to test explicitly for every
mode.  We don&rsquo;t expect anyone to miss those fancy variables.

</li><li> The default preference for servicing sub-processes that produce output at a
high rate, and the associated variable <code>process-prioritize-lower-fds</code>,
have been removed.  Moving back in time means fewer and fewer programs can
produce such high-rate output, so this features becomes just useless crud.

</li><li> The encodings that are variants of EBCDIC were removed.  This includes
<code>ibm256</code>, <code>ibm273</code>, and others&mdash;variants of the EBCDIC encoding
tailored for some Japanese and European locales.  You won&rsquo;t need those where
you are going.

</li><li> The &ldquo;Bindat type expression&rdquo; description language has been removed, as the
existing data layout specifications are perfectly suited for this job.

</li><li> To simplify code and reduce complexity, we removed the capability of
specifying the success handler in <code>condition-case</code> via the
<code>:success</code> keyword.  If you really need this feature (why would you?),
you can always write some simple Lisp that has the same effect.

</li><li> Emacs modules can no longer provide interactive functions, or install
finalizers, nor open channels to existing pipe sub-processes.  All this is
extra ballast, especially since we plan on removing modules in some past
Emacs version.  The <code>make_unibyte_string</code> module API was removed for
the same reason.

</li><li> To keep Emacs clean and elegant, we&rsquo;ve removed the
<code>print-integers-as-characters</code> option.  Recognizing characters by their
decimal codes is a basic requirement for Emacs Lisp programmers, and with
the expected decrease in use of Unicode characters, this will be soon
limited to ASCII only: surely something you all can master!

</li><li> The optional <var>count</var> argument of the <code>directory-files</code> function has
been removed.  Extracting the first <var>n</var> members from the full list is
trivial, so this is a significant simplification for an insignificant cost.

</li><li> Functions that create sub-processes and network connections no longer accept
the <code>:coding</code> argument; use <code>set-process-coding-system</code> or bind
<code>coding-system-for-read/write</code> instead: again, a significant reduction
in Emacs complexity for little or no cost.

</li><li> We deleted from the macros <code>define-derived-mode</code> and
<code>define-minor-mode</code> the code which allowed using the
<code>:interactive</code> argument.  The possibility of marking a mode
non-interactive makes very little sense,

</li><li> The possibility of having links to man pages in doc strings has been
removed.  Use plain text instead, if you need such references.

</li><li> Temporary buffers are no longer exempt from running any buffer-related
hooks.  Programs that don&rsquo;t want such hooks in some buffer can always
disable it locally, whereas making that simpler complicates Emacs for no
good reason.

</li><li> Several features that complicated the byte compiler have been removed:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- The checks for missing declarations of dynamic variables.  This will
continue making less and less sense as we move away of lexical-binding
support.

</li><li>- The ability of compiling symlinked <samp>*.el</samp> files, which is really gross:
copy the files instead.

</li><li>- The warnings about too-wide doc strings&mdash;that is just a nuisance, as the
programmers should be trusted to know what they are doing.
</li></ul>


</li><li> We deleted several features of the <code>pcase</code> macro, in accordance with
our general plan to remove <code>pcase</code> from Emacs:

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- The <code>cl-type</code> pattern.

</li><li>- the <code>pcase-setq</code> macro.

</li><li>- The <code>pcase-compile-patterns</code> function.
</li></ul>

</li><li> Some of the keywords used in Edebug specification lists were deemed to be of
little use, and were therefore removed: <code>&amp;interpose</code>, <code>&amp;error</code>,
and <code>&amp;name</code>.  The long-term plane is for Emacs to drop Edebug entirely,
leaving only the trusted Lisp debugger, and we continue working according to
that plan.

</li><li> The function <code>object-intervals</code> was dropped, as a Lisp program can
easily collect the intervals of a buffer or a string by iterating through
them one by one.

</li><li> We decided that the <code>require-theme</code> function is an unnecessary
complication, so we deleted it.  Lisp programs can easily search along
<code>custom-theme-load-path</code> instead.

</li><li> The convenience functions <code>length&lt;</code>, <code>length&gt;</code>, and <code>length=</code>
were removed, as using <code>length</code> followed by a comparison should be good
enough for everyone, especially considering that the typical length of a
list keeps going down as you move back through time.

</li><li> The variable <code>current-minibuffer-command</code> is no longer available, as we
found little justification for keeping it.

</li><li> As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other functions and
variables have been eliminated.  Other functions and variables, that were
declared obsolete since Emacs 23, have been added back, in preparation for
releasing Emacs 23 in some distant past.
</li></ul>
