<span id="Emacs-29-Antinews"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Emacs 29 Antinews</h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 29.4.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;30.0.60<!-- /@w -->
features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Mouse wheel events once again follow the platform and window-system
conventions: sometimes they are <code>wheel-up/down</code> and sometimes
<code>mouse-4/5/6/7</code>.  Lisp programs which use these should once again be
aware of the conventions in effect and behave accordingly.

</li><li> The command <code>describe-function</code> no longer distracts you by showing
unnecessary details like the type of the function&rsquo;s object.  Emacs hackers
always know whether a function is a primitive, a native-compiled Lisp
function, or any other kind.  Stating the obvious simply wastes the precious
screen estate; as you move into the past, and the typical dimensions of the
screen become smaller, that waste is less and less justified.  So we made
the waste smaller.

</li><li> The support for styled underline in face attribute was dropped.  The simple
underline should be enough; anything else is just code bloat and creeping
featurism.  Colorful underlines on TTY frames are no longer supported for
the same reason.

</li><li> IELM stopped recording its input history.  You will no longer be annoyed by
inputs from your past sessions; each session starts with a clean slate.
What can be simpler and easier to remember?

</li><li> You can no longer disable JavaScript in xwidget Webkit sessions.  Since
xwidgets are going away in one of the previous Emacs versions, we decided to
make this one step in that direction and get rid of this complication.

</li><li> The <code>minibuffer-regexp-mode</code> was removed.  Regular expressions are just
strings, so no fancy mode should be needed for editing them.

</li><li> We removed the Compat package.  Forward compatibility for ELPA packages
becomes less and less important as you move back through time, and soon
enough ELPA will disappear entirely.  We decided it was prudent to start
preparing for that now.

</li><li> We are back to interpreting <code>\x</code> without any following hex digits as
character code zero (<acronym>NUL</acronym>), as it always was in Emacs.  The savings
in typing due to this alone are enough to justify this simplification.

</li><li> To keep Emacs clean and elegant, we&rsquo;ve removed the ability to show tooltips
for fringe bitmaps.  What important information cam be shown on the fringes,
and why would it require tooltips to explain its purpose? We decided it
isn&rsquo;t justified to keep this in past versions of Emacs.

</li><li> Fancy sorting-related facilities, like the <code>value&lt;</code> function and
keyword arguments for <code>sort</code>, were deleted as too complex.  The basic
<code>sort</code> function should all that&rsquo;s needed in the years to go.

</li><li> Features related to the inheritance graph of major modes were deemed
unnecessary and thus were dropped.  This includes
<code>provided-mode-derived-p</code>, <code>derived-mode-add-parents</code>, and
others.  We decided that untangling the mode inheritance relationships by
hand facilitates more clear code and makes the intent evident.

</li><li> We removed unnecessary functionality for handling touch screen events, as
touch screens gradually disappear from view as you move back in time.
There&rsquo;s no need to keep obsolete these new inventions in the past.

</li><li> Various new functions and variables for moving and transposing sexps and for
moving by program statements were dropped as unnecessary.  The original
commands that move by balanced expressions are more than enough.

</li><li> We deleted some fancy <code>declare</code> forms for functions, such as
<code>ftype</code>.  Emacs Lisp is not a string-typed language, which makes these
declarations anathema.  The types <code>closure</code> and
<code>interpreted-function</code> are gone for the same reason: no need to
distinguish types of Lisp functions.

</li><li> The byte compiler stopped issuing warnings about practices some purists
consider questionable.  This includes warnings about missing
<code>lexical-binding</code> cookies, empty bodies of special forms and macros,
comparison with literals, <code>condition-case</code> without handlers, mutation
of constants, and some others.  As time moves into the past, the typical
Emacs hacker knows best what&rsquo;s correct code and what isn&rsquo;t, and thus these
warnings become useless annoyances.  Good riddance!

</li><li> The <code>obarray</code> type is gone.  Obarrays are back to their original
representation as vectors.  Each removed Lisp data type makes Emacs simpler
and easier to use, so this is a welcome deletion.

</li><li> 簡略化にたいする継続要求の一環として、その他の多くの関数と変数が排除されました。他にはEmacs
24以降で廃止と宣言された関数および変数が、過去のある時点におけるEmacs 24リリースの準備に向けて再び追加されています。
</li></ul>
