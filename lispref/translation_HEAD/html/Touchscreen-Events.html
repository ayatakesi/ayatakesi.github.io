<span id="index-touchscreen-events"></span>
<span id="index-support-for-touchscreens"></span>

<p>Some window systems provide support for input devices that react to the
user&rsquo;s touching the screen and moving fingers while touching the screen.
These input devices are known as touchscreens, and Emacs reports the events
they generate as <em>touchscreen events</em>.
</p>
<p>Most individual events generated by a touchscreen only have meaning as part
of a larger sequence of other events: for instance, the simple operation of
tapping the touchscreen involves the user placing and raising a finger on
the touchscreen, and swiping the display to scroll it involves placing a
finger, moving it many times upwards or downwards, and then raising the
finger.
</p>
<span id="index-touch-point_002c-in-touchscreen-events"></span>
<p>While a simplistic model consisting of one finger is adequate for taps and
scrolling, more complicated gestures require support for keeping track of
multiple fingers, where the position of each finger is represented by a
<em>touch point</em>.  For example, a &ldquo;pinch to zoom&rdquo; gesture might consist
of the user placing two fingers and moving them individually in opposite
directions, where the distance between the positions of their individual
points determine the amount by which to zoom the display, and the center of
an imaginary line between those positions determines where to pan the
display after zooming.
</p>
<p>The low-level touchscreen events described below can be used to implement
all the touch sequences described above.  In those events, each point is
represented by a cons of an arbitrary number identifying the point and a
mouse position list (see <a href="Click-Events.html">クリックイベント</a>) specifying the position of the
finger when the event occurred.

<dl compact="compact">
<dd><span id="index-touchscreen_002dbegin-event"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>(touchscreen-begin <var>point</var>)</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This event is sent when <var>point</var> is created by the user pressing a finger
against the touchscreen.

<span id="index-touchscreen_002dupdate-event"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>(touchscreen-update <var>points</var>)</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This event is sent when a point on the touchscreen has changed position.
<var>points</var> is a list of touch points containing the up-to-date positions
of each touch point currently on the touchscreen.

<dt><span><code>(touchscreen-end <var>point</var>)</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This event is sent when <var>point</var> is no longer present on the display,
because another program took the grab, or because the user raised the finger
from the touchscreen.
