<span id="Keeping-track-of-buffer-modifications"></span><h4 class="subsection">33.34.1 Keeping track of buffer modifications</h4>
<span id="index-track_002dchanges"></span>
<span id="index-change-tracker"></span>

<p>Using <code>before-change-functions</code> and <code>after-change-functions</code> can
be difficult in practice because of a number of pitfalls, such as the fact
that the two calls are not always properly paired, or some calls may be
missing, either because some Emacs primitives failed to properly pair them
or because of incorrect use of <code>inhibit-modification-hooks</code>.
Furthermore, many restrictions apply to those hook functions, such as the
fact that they basically should never modify the current buffer, nor use an
operation that may block, and they proceed quickly because some commands may
call these hooks a large number of times.
</p>
<p>The Track-Changes library fundamentally provides an alternative API, built
on top of those hooks.  Compared to <code>after-change-functions</code>, the first
important difference is that, instead of providing the bounds of the change
and the previous length, it provides the bounds of the change and the actual
previous content of that region.  The need to extract information from the
original contents of the buffer is one of the main reasons why some packages
need to use both <code>before-change-functions</code> and
<code>after-change-functions</code> and then try to match them up.
</p>
<p>The second difference is that it decouples the notification of a change from
the act of processing it, and it automatically combines into a single change
operation all the changes that occur between the first change and the actual
processing.  This makes it natural and easy to process the changes at a
larger granularity, such as once per command, and eliminates most of the
restrictions that apply to the usual change hook functions, making it
possible to use blocking operations or to modify the buffer.
</p>
<p>To start tracking changes, you have to call <code>track-changes-register</code>,
passing it a <var>signal</var> function as argument.  This returns a tracker
<var>id</var> which is used to identify your change tracker to the other
functions of the library.  When the buffer is modified, the library calls
the <var>signal</var> function to inform you of that change and immediately
starts accumulating subsequent changes into a single combined change.  The
<var>signal</var> function serves only to warn that a modification occurred but
does not receive a description of the change.  Also the library will not
call it again until after you retrieved the change.
</p>
<p>To retrieve changes, you need to call <code>track-changes-fetch</code>, which
provides you with the bounds of the changes accumulated since the last call,
as well as the previous content of that region.  It also &ldquo;re-arms&rdquo; the
<var>signal</var> function so that the library will call it again after the next
buffer modification.
</p>
<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-track_002dchanges_002dregister"><span class="category">Function: </span><span><strong>track-changes-register</strong> <em>signal &amp;key nobefore disjoint immediate</em><a href='#index-track_002dchanges_002dregister' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This function creates a new <em>change tracker</em>.  Change trackers are kept
abstract, so we refer to them as mere identities, and the function thus
returns the tracker&rsquo;s <var>id</var>.
</p>
<p><var>signal</var> is a function that the library will call to notify of a
change.  It will sometimes call it with a single argument and sometimes with
two.  Upon the first change to the buffer since this tracker last called
<code>track-changes-fetch</code>, the library calls this <var>signal</var> function
with a single argument holding the <var>id</var> of the tracker.
</p>
<p>By default, the call to the <var>signal</var> function does not happen
immediately, but is instead postponed with a 0 seconds timer
(see <a href="Timers.html">遅延実行のためのタイマー</a>).  This is usually desired to make sure the <var>signal</var>
function is not called too frequently and runs in a permissive context,
freeing the client from performance concerns or worries about which
operations might be problematic.  If a client wants to have more control,
they can provide a non-<code>nil</code> value as the <var>immediate</var> argument in
which case the library calls the <var>signal</var> function directly from
<code>after-change-functions</code>.  Beware that it means that the <var>signal</var>
function has to be careful not to modify the buffer or use operations that
may block.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not interested in the actual previous content of the buffer, but
are using this library only for its ability to combine many small changes
into a larger one and to delay the processing to a more convenient time, you
can specify a non-<code>nil</code> value for the <var>nobefore</var> argument.  In that
case, <code>track-change-fetch</code> provides you only with the length of the
previous content, just like <code>after-change-functions</code>.  It also allows
the library to save some work.
</p>
<p>While you may like to accumulate many small changes into larger ones, you
may not want to do that if the changes are too far apart.  If you specify a
non-<code>nil</code> value for the <var>disjoint</var> argument, the library will let
you know when a change is about to occur &ldquo;far&rdquo; from the currently pending
ones by calling the <var>signal</var> function right away, passing it two
arguments this time: the <var>id</var> of the tracker, and the number of
characters that separates the upcoming change from the already pending
changes.  This in itself does not prevent combining this new change with the
previous ones, so if you think the upcoming change is indeed too far, you
need to call <code>track-change-fetch</code> right away.  Beware that when the
<var>signal</var> function is called because of a disjoint change, this happens
directly from <code>before-change-functions</code>, so the usual restrictions
apply about modifying the buffer or using operations that may block.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-track_002dchanges_002dfetch"><span class="category">Function: </span><span><strong>track-changes-fetch</strong> <em>id func</em><a href='#index-track_002dchanges_002dfetch' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the function that lets you find out what has changed in the buffer.
By providing the tracker <var>id</var> you let the library figure out which
changes have already been seen by your tracker.  Instead of returning a
description of the changes, <code>track-changes-fetch</code> calls the <var>func</var>
function with that description in the form of 3 arguments: <var>beg</var>,
<var>end</var>, and <var>before</var>, where <code><var>beg</var>..<var>end</var></code> delimit the
region that was modified and <var>before</var> describes the previous content of
that region.  Usually <var>before</var> is a string containing the previous text
of the modified region, but if you specified a non-<code>nil</code> <var>nobefore</var>
argument to <code>track-changes-register</code>, then it is replaced by the number
of characters of that previous text.
</p>
<p>In case no changes occurred since the last call, <code>track-changes-fetch</code>
simply does not call <var>func</var> and returns <code>nil</code>.  If changes did
occur, it calls <var>func</var> and returns the value returned by <var>func</var>.
But note that <var>func</var> is called just once regardless of how many changes
occurred: those are summarized into a single
<var>beg</var>/<var>end</var>/<var>before</var> triplet.
</p>
<p>In some cases, the library is not properly notified of all changes, for
example because of a bug in the low-level C code or because of an improper
use of <code>inhibit-modification-hooks</code>.  When it detects such a problem,
<var>func</var> receives a <code><var>beg</var>..<var>end</var></code> region which covers the
whole buffer and the <var>before</var> argument is the symbol <code>error</code> to
indicate that the library was unable to determine what was changed.
</p>
<p>Once <var>func</var> finishes, <code>track-changes-fetch</code> re-enables the
<var>signal</var> function so that it will be called the next time a change
occurs.  This is the reason why it calls <var>func</var> instead of returning a
description: it lets you process the change without worrying about the risk
that the <var>signal</var> function gets triggered in the middle of it, because
the <var>signal</var> is re-enabled only after <var>func</var> finishes.

<dd><p>This function tells the library that the tracker <var>id</var> does not need to
know about buffer changes any more.  Most clients will never want to stop
tracking changes, but for clients such as minor modes, it is important to
call this function when the minor mode is disabled, otherwise the tracker
will keep accumulating changes and consume more and more resources.
