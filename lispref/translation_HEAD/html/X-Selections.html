<span id="X-Selections-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">30.22.1 X Selections</h4>

<p>X refrains from defining fixed data types for selection data or a fixed
number of selections.  Selections are identified by X &ldquo;atoms&rdquo;, which are
unique 29-bit identifiers issued by the X server for string names.  This
complexity is hidden by Emacs: when Lisp provides a symbol whose name is
that of the atom, Emacs will request these identifiers without further
intervention.
</p>
<p>When a program &ldquo;sets&rdquo; a selection under X, it actually makes itself the
&ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the selection&mdash;the X server will then deliver selection
requests to the program, which is obliged to respond to the requesting
client with the selection data.
</p>
<p>Similarly, a program does not &ldquo;get&rdquo; selection data from the X server.
Instead, its selection requests are sent to the client with the window which
last asserted ownership over the selection, which is expected to respond
with the requested data.
</p>
<p>Each selection request incorporates three parameters:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The window which requested the selection, which identifies the requesting
program, otherwise known as the <em>requestor</em>.

</li><li> An atom identifying the <em>target</em> to which the owner should convert the
selection.  It is easiest to think of the conversion target as the kind of
data that the requestor wants: in selection requests made by Emacs, the
target is determined by the <var>type</var> argument to <code>gui-get-selection</code>.

</li><li> A 32-bit timestamp representing the X server time at which the requestor
last received input; this parameter is not relevant to Lisp code, for it&rsquo;s
only meant to abet synchronization between the X server, owner and
requestor.
</li></ul>

<p>The selection owner responds by transferring to the requestor a series of
bytes, 16 bit words, or 32 bit words, along with another atom identifying
the type of those words.  After requesting a selection, Emacs then applies
its own interpretation of the data format and data type to convert the data
transferred by the selection owner to a Lisp representation, which
<code>gui-get-selection</code> returns.
</p>
<p>Emacs converts selection data consisting of any series of bytes to a unibyte
string holding those bytes, that consisting of a single 16-bit or 32-bit
word as an unsigned number, and that consisting of multiple such words as a
vector of unsigned numbers.  The exceptions to this general pattern are that
Emacs applies special treatment for data from the following conversion
targets:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><code>INTEGER</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>16-bit or 32-bit words of this type are treated as signed rather than
unsigned integers.  If there are multiple words in the selection data, a
vector is returned; otherwise, the integer is returned by itself.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>ATOM</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>32-bit words of this type are treated as X atoms, and returned (either alone
or as vectors) as Lisp symbols by the names they identify.  Invalid atoms
are replaced by <code>nil</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>COMPOUND_TEXT</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>UTF8_STRING</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>STRING</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>A single <code>foreign-selection</code> text property set to the type of the
selection data will be placed in unibyte strings derived from a request for
these data types.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Each selection owner must return at least two selection targets:
<code>TARGETS</code>, which returns a number of atoms describing the selection
targets that the owner supports, and <code>MULTIPLE</code>, used for internal
purposes by X clients.  A selection owner may support any number of other
targets, some of which may be standardized by the X Consortium&rsquo;s
<a href="http://x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xorg-docs/specs/ICCCM/icccm.html">Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</a>, while others, such as
<code>UTF8_STRING</code>, were meant to be standardized by the XFree86 Project,
but their standardization was never completed.
</p>
<p>Requests for a given selection target may, by convention, return data in a
specific type, or it may return data in one of several types, whichever is
most convenient for the selection owner; the latter type of selection target
is dubbed a <em>polymorphic target</em>.  In response to a request, a selection
target may also return no data at all, whereafter the selection owner
executes some action as a side effect.  Targets that are thus replied to are
termed <em>side-effect targets</em>.
</p>
<p>Here are some selection targets whose behavior is generally consistent with
a standard when requested from the <code>CLIPBOARD</code>, <code>PRIMARY</code>, or
<code>SECONDARY</code> selections.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><code>ADOBE_PORTABLE_DOCUMENT_FORMAT</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns data in Adobe System&rsquo;s &ldquo;Portable Document Format&rdquo;
format, as a string.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>APPLE_PICT</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns data in the &ldquo;PICT&rdquo; image format used on Macintosh
computers, as a string.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>BACKGROUND</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>BITMAP</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>COLORMAP</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>FOREGROUND</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Together, these four targets return integer data necessary to make use of a
bitmap image stored on the X server: the pixel value of the bitmap&rsquo;s
background color, the X identifier of the bitmap, the colormap inside which
the background and foreground are allocated, and the pixel value of the
bitmap&rsquo;s foreground color.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>CHARACTER_POSITION</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns two unsigned 32-bit integers of type <code>SPAN</code>
describing the start and end positions of the selection data in the text
field containing it, in bytes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>COMPOUND_TEXT</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns a string of type <code>COMPOUND_TEXT</code> in the X
Consortium&rsquo;s multi-byte text encoding system.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>DELETE</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns nothing, but as a side-effect deletes the selection
contents from any text field containing them.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>DRAWABLE</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>PIXMAP</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns a list of unsigned 32-bit integers, each of which
corresponds to an X server drawable or pixmap.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>ENCAPSULATED_POSTSCRIPT</code></span></dt>
<dt><span><code>_ADOBE_EPS</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns a string containing encapsulated Postscript code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>FILE_NAME</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns a string containing one or more file names, separated by
NULL characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>HOST_NAME</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns a string containing the fully-qualified domain name of
the machine on which the selection owner is running.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>USER</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns a string containing the user name of the machine on
which the selection owner is running.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>LENGTH</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns an unsigned 32-bit or 16-bit integer containing the
length of the selection data.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>LINE_NUMBER</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns two unsigned 32-bit integers of type <code>SPAN</code>
describing the line numbers corresponding to the start and end positions of
the selection data in the text field containing it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>MODULE</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns the name of any function containing the selection data.
It is principally requested by text editors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>STRING</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns the selection data as a string of type <code>STRING</code>,
encoded in ISO Latin-1 format, with Unix newline characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>C_STRING</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns the selection data as a &ldquo;C string&rdquo;.  This has been
interpreted as meaning the raw selection data in whatever encoding used by
the owner, either terminated with a NULL byte or not at all, or an ASCII
string which may or may not be terminated.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>UTF8_STRING</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This returns the selection data as a string of type <code>UTF8_STRING</code>,
encoded in UTF-8, with unspecified EOL format.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>TIMESTAMP</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This target returns the X server time at which the selection owner took
ownership over the selection as a 16-bit or 32-bit word of type
<code>CARDINAL</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>TEXT</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This polymorphic target returns selection data as a string, either
<code>COMPOUND_TEXT</code>, <code>STRING</code>, <code>C_STRING</code>, or <code>UTF8_STRING</code>,
whichever data type is convenient for the selection owner.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>When a request for the targets <code>STRING</code>, <code>COMPOUND_TEXT</code>, or
<code>UTF8_STRING</code> is made using the function <code>gui-get-selection</code>, and
neither <code>selection-coding-system</code> nor
<code>next-selection-coding-system</code> is set, the resultant strings are
decoded by the proper coding systems for those targets: <code>iso-8859-1</code>,
<code>compound-text-with-extensions</code> and <code>utf-8</code> respectively.
</p>
<p>In addition to the targets specified above (and the many targets used by
various programs for their own purposes), several popular programs and
toolkits have defined selection data types of their own, without consulting
the appropriate X standards bodies.  These targets are generally named after
such MIME types as <code>text/html</code> or <code>image/jpeg</code>; they have been
witnessed returning the following forms of data:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Unterminated, newline terminated, or NULL character terminated file names of
an image or text file.

</li><li> Image or text data in the appropriate format.

</li><li> <code>file://</code> URIs (or conceivably newline or NUL terminated lists of URIs)
identifying files in the appropriate format.
</li></ul>

<p>These selection targets were first used by Netscape, but are now proffered
by all kinds of programs, especially those based on recent versions of the
GTK+ or Qt toolkits.
</p>
<p>Emacs is also capable of serving as a selection owner.  When
<code>gui-set-selection</code> is called, the selection data provided is recorded
internally and Emacs obtains ownership of the selection being set.
</p>
<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-selection_002dconverter_002dalist"><span class="category">Variable: </span><span><strong>selection-converter-alist</strong><a href='#index-selection_002dconverter_002dalist' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Alist of selection targets to &ldquo;selection converter&rdquo; functions.  When a
selection request is received, Emacs looks up the selection converter
pertaining to the requested selection target.
</p>
<p>Selection converters are called with three arguments: the symbol
corresponding to the atom identifying the selection being requested, the
selection target that is being requested, and the value set with
<code>gui-set-selection</code>.  The values which they must return are either
conses of symbols designating the data type and numbers, symbols, vectors of
numbers or symbols, or the cdrs of such conses by themselves.
</p>
<p>If a selection converter&rsquo;s value is the special symbol <code>NULL</code>, the data
type returned to its requestor is set to <code>NULL</code>, and no data is sent in
response.
</p>
<p>If such a value is a string, it must be a unibyte string; should no data
type be explicitly specified, the data is transferred to its requestor with
the type <code>STRING</code>.
</p>
<p>If it is a symbol, its &ldquo;atom&rdquo; is retrieved, and it is transferred to its
requestor as a 32-bit value&mdash;if no data type is specified, its type is
<code>ATOM</code>.
</p>
<p>If it is a number between <code>-32769</code> and <code>32768</code>, it is transferred
to its requestor as a 16 bit value&mdash;if no data type is specified, its type
is <code>INTEGER</code>.
</p>
<p>If it is any other number, it is accounted a 32 bit value.  Even if the
number returned is unsigned, its requestor will treat words of type
<code>INTEGER</code> as signed.  To return an unsigned value, specify the type
<code>CARDINAL</code> in its place.
</p>
<p>If it is a vector of symbols or numbers, the response to its requestor will
be a list of multiple atoms or numbers.  The data type returned when not
expressly set is that of the list&rsquo;s first element.
