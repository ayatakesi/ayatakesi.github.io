<span id="Emacs-26-Antinews"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Emacs 26 Antinews</h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 26.3.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;27.1<!-- /@w -->
features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Lisp objects are again implemented on the C level as integer types, not as
pointers.  This might be a small step for Emacs Lisp users, but it&rsquo;s a giant
leap for the Emacs developers who work on the C level, since it is now again
easy to print Lisp object in the debugger in the decimal format, which is so
much easier for debugging.  It also makes calling Emacs functions from the
debugger easier, and allows us to freely mix integers and Lisp objects in
the C code.

</li><li> The test suite was removed from the distribution tarball.  We believe that
tests need seldom if ever be run, certainly not by the end users.  Removing
the tests from the tarball makes it much smaller, which is important since
disk space becomes more and more at premium as you move back in time.

</li><li> Dynamic module support is disabled by default.  This both makes Emacs
smaller (a worthy goal by itself), and removes the complications and
additional complexity related with installing module support files and
letting random shared objects an opportunity to be loaded into Emacs and
mess with it.

</li><li> You now must activate any installed packages only after loading your init
files.  That requires an explicit call to <code>package-initialize</code> in your
init file, which is a Good Thing, as it makes you think seriously where and
indeed whether you&rsquo;d like your packages to become available to your
sessions.  Simplicity should tramp convenience!

</li><li> To reduce the amount of code in Emacs related to unimportant features, we&rsquo;ve
removed native rotation and resizing of images.  You will have to build
Emacs with ImageMagick if you want to resize or rotate images inside Emacs.
We don&rsquo;t expect anyone to miss that.

</li><li> We&rsquo;ve re-enabled color fonts usage by the XFT font back-end.  We consider
the availability of these fonts more important than a random crash here and
there, especially since the use of these fonts for displaying Emoji will
become less and less important as we travel back in time, and will
completely disappear in some past Emacs version.

</li><li> The function <code>network-interface-list</code> can now return only IPv4
addresses.  We consider the complexity introduced by IPv6 to be too much to
be justified, and on the other hand its removal is the step in the right
direction, given that IPv6 is expected to be completely removed as we move
back in time.

</li><li> The limit on repetitions in regular expressions was reduced to
2**15 - 1.
We envision that regular expressions will become more and more simple as we
move towards the distant past.

</li><li> To simplify code and reduce complexity, we removed the capability of
searching programs on remote hosts in <code>executable-find</code>.  If you really
need this feature (why would you?), you can always write your own shell
script and run it on the remote.

</li><li> The <code>:extend</code> face attribute is no longer available; all faces have
their background color extended by default past end of line.  This should
significantly simplify face management and remove unnecessary code bloat, as
well as make faces significantly simpler to understand and use.

</li><li> The predicates <code>display-blink-cursor-p</code> and
<code>display-symbol-keys-p</code> were deleted.  They are rarely if ever needed,
and can easily be substituted by appropriate calls to old and proven APIs
like <code>display-graphic-p</code>.  As an additional bonus, writing Lisp
programs that depend on this functionality will make sure the programmer
understands better what exactly is the required features of the display
terminal.

</li><li> Relative directories in the value of the <code>HOME</code> environment variable are
once again interpreted relative to the <code>default-directory</code> of the
current buffer.  This is much simpler, and also allows <code>HOME</code> to resolve
to a different place in different buffers, which allows some interesting
applications.

<p>For the same reasons, <code>file-name-absolute-p</code> now again considers
<samp>~foo</samp> an absolute file name, even if there&rsquo;s no known user
&lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;.  This means a Lisp program which uses such file names will
always work the same on any system, regardless of its known users.
</p>
</li><li> File-related primitives like <code>file-attributes</code>, <code>file-modes</code>,
<code>file-newer-than-file-p</code>, and some others once again return <code>nil</code>
when the underlying low-level APIs fail, instead of signaling an error.  We
decided that functions which signal errors require more complex code from
Lisp programs which use them, and found this complexity unjustified when
returning <code>nil</code> will do.

</li><li> Similarly, old-style backquotes no longer signal errors; they generate
warnings instead.  You can remove error handling from programs that use
backquotes.

</li><li> Formatting floating-point numbers has been sped up by letting the underlying
implementation produce unpredictable values, instead of signaling errors
when the number is too large to format correctly.  We believe the Emacs Lisp
programmers should always know what they are doing when they deal with
floating-point values.

</li><li> The function <code>read-char-from-minibuffer</code> was deleted.  We decided that
<code>read-char</code> should be enough for any Lisp program that needs to ask the
user for a single-character input, in recognition of the fact that nothing
makes Emacs Lisp hackers rejoice more than the need to sit down and write
yet another interactive question-and-answer function, and make it optimal
for each specific case.  Consequently, no history is provided for such
responses (why would someone want history of single-key strokes, anyway?).

</li><li> The function <code>ngettext</code> was deleted.  Non-English languages will become
less and less widespread, let alone useful, as you move back in time, so we
took this small step in that direction, and simplified Emacs as a nice
bonus.

</li><li> Focus-change notifications on text-mode frames are no longer recognized or
supported.  You can now safely disregard the possibility of receiving such
notifications on TTY frames.  This is one small step on the long road of
removing all non-character input events Emacs supports on TTY frames.

</li><li> Face specifications in <code>face-remapping-alist</code> now have to be
buffer-specific, without any differences between windows showing the same
buffers.  This allowed us to remove a lot of unneeded code bloat from Emacs,
and make the face handling much simpler.

</li><li> The &lsquo;<samp>%o</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>%x</samp>&rsquo; formats now always produce unsigned values, as
you&rsquo;d expect.  This allows you to reveal the underlying machine
representation, which is different on each architecture, something we
consider a valuable feature.

</li><li> We no longer highlight in <code>font-lock-warning-face</code> symbols with
confusable quote characters, such as U+2018.  Detecting them needed
non-trivial amount of code, and we firmly believe that Lisp programmers
always know what they are doing, and don&rsquo;t need to be annoyed with typefaces
that stand out and distract.

</li><li> The function <code>file-system-info</code> was dropped on Posix platforms, since
you can always invoke <code>df</code> instead and parse its output.

</li><li> The functions that implement the &lsquo;<samp>base64url</samp>&rsquo; encoding were removed, as
they can always be emulated by suitable tweaking of the normal base-64
encoding.  No need to bloat Emacs and force Lisp programmers learn more
interfaces on this account.

</li><li> 簡略化にたいする継続要求の一環として、他の多くの関数と変数が排除されました。
</li></ul>
