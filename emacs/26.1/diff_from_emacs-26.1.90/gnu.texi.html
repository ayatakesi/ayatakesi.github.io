<a name="line48"><font color="#000000">048:</font></a> <font color="#009900">learned to distinguish carefully between ``free'' in the sense of</font>
<a name="line49"><font color="#000000">049:</font></a> <font color="#009900">freedom and ``free'' in the sense of price.  Free software is software</font>

<a name="line55"><font color="#000000">055:</font></a> me.  Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly
<a name="line56"><font color="#000000">056:</font></a> needed.
<a name="line57"><font color="#000000">057:</font></a> 
<a name="line58"><font color="#000000">058:</font></a> So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor commands,
<a name="line59"><font color="#000000">059:</font></a> a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, a linker, and
<a name="line60"><font color="#000000">060:</font></a> around 35 utilities.  A shell (command interpreter) is nearly completed.  A
<a name="line61"><font color="#000000">061:</font></a> new portable optimizing C compiler has compiled itself and may be released
<a name="line62"><font color="#000000">062:</font></a> this year.  An initial kernel exists but many more features are needed to
<a name="line63"><font color="#000000">063:</font></a> emulate Unix.  When the kernel and compiler are finished, it will be
<a name="line64"><font color="#000000">064:</font></a> possible to distribute a GNU system suitable for program development.  We
<a name="line65"><font color="#000000">065:</font></a> will use <b><font color="#0000FF">@TeX</font></b><font color="#009900">{}</font> as our text formatter, but an nroff is being worked on.  We
<a name="line66"><font color="#000000">066:</font></a> will use the free, portable X window system as well.  After this we will
<a name="line67"><font color="#000000">067:</font></a> add a portable Common Lisp, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of
<a name="line68"><font color="#000000">068:</font></a> other things, plus on-line documentation.  We hope to supply, eventually,
<a name="line69"><font color="#000000">069:</font></a> everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system, and more.

<a name="line71"><font color="#000000">071:</font></a> GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to Unix.
<a name="line72"><font color="#000000">072:</font></a> We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our experience
<a name="line73"><font color="#000000">073:</font></a> with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to have longer
<a name="line74"><font color="#000000">074:</font></a> file names, file version numbers, a crashproof file system, file name
<a name="line75"><font color="#000000">075:</font></a> completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and perhaps
<a name="line76"><font color="#000000">076:</font></a> eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp programs
<a name="line77"><font color="#000000">077:</font></a> and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C and Lisp will be
<a name="line78"><font color="#000000">078:</font></a> available as system programming languages.  We will try to support UUCP,
<a name="line79"><font color="#000000">079:</font></a> MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for communication.

<a name="line81"><font color="#000000">081:</font></a> GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000/16000 class with virtual
<a name="line82"><font color="#000000">082:</font></a> memory, because they are the easiest machines to make it run on.  The extra

<a name="line84"><font color="#000000">084:</font></a> to use it on them.

<a name="line90"><font color="#000000">090:</font></a> 
<a name="line91"><font color="#000000">091:</font></a> I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must
<a name="line92"><font color="#000000">092:</font></a> share it with other people who like it.  Software sellers want to divide
<a name="line93"><font color="#000000">093:</font></a> the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with
<a name="line94"><font color="#000000">094:</font></a> others.  I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way.  I
<a name="line95"><font color="#000000">095:</font></a> cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software
<a name="line96"><font color="#000000">096:</font></a> license agreement.  For years I worked within the Artificial Intelligence
<a name="line97"><font color="#000000">097:</font></a> Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities, but eventually
<a name="line98"><font color="#000000">098:</font></a> they had gone too far: I could not remain in an institution where such

<a name="line117"><font color="#000000">117:</font></a> further redistribution.  That is to say, proprietary modifications will not

<a name="line121"><font color="#000000">121:</font></a> 
<a name="line122"><font color="#000000">122:</font></a> I have found many other programmers who are excited about GNU and want to
<a name="line123"><font color="#000000">123:</font></a> help.
<a name="line124"><font color="#000000">124:</font></a> 
<a name="line125"><font color="#000000">125:</font></a> Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization of system
<a name="line126"><font color="#000000">126:</font></a> software.  It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them to
<a name="line127"><font color="#000000">127:</font></a> feel in conflict with other programmers in general rather than feel as
<a name="line128"><font color="#000000">128:</font></a> comrades.  The fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the
<a name="line129"><font color="#000000">129:</font></a> sharing of programs; marketing arrangements now typically used essentially
<a name="line130"><font color="#000000">130:</font></a> forbid programmers to treat others as friends.  The purchaser of software
<a name="line131"><font color="#000000">131:</font></a> must choose between friendship and obeying the law.  Naturally, many decide
<a name="line132"><font color="#000000">132:</font></a> that friendship is more important.  But those who believe in law often do
<a name="line133"><font color="#000000">133:</font></a> not feel at ease with either choice.  They become cynical and think that
<a name="line134"><font color="#000000">134:</font></a> programming is just a way of making money.
<a name="line135"><font color="#000000">135:</font></a> 
<a name="line136"><font color="#000000">136:</font></a> By working on and using GNU rather than proprietary programs, we can be
<a name="line137"><font color="#000000">137:</font></a> hospitable to everyone and obey the law.  In addition, GNU serves as an
<a name="line138"><font color="#000000">138:</font></a> example to inspire and a banner to rally others to join us in sharing.
<a name="line139"><font color="#000000">139:</font></a> This can give us a feeling of harmony which is impossible if we use
<a name="line140"><font color="#000000">140:</font></a> software that is not free.  For about half the programmers I talk to, this
<a name="line141"><font color="#000000">141:</font></a> is an important happiness that money cannot replace.

<a name="line148"><font color="#000000">148:</font></a> One consequence you can expect if you donate machines is that GNU will run
<a name="line149"><font color="#000000">149:</font></a> on them at an early date.  The machines should be complete, ready to use
<a name="line150"><font color="#000000">150:</font></a> systems, approved for use in a residential area, and not in need of
<a name="line151"><font color="#000000">151:</font></a> sophisticated cooling or power.
<a name="line152"><font color="#000000">152:</font></a> 
<a name="line153"><font color="#000000">153:</font></a> I have found very many programmers eager to contribute part-time work for

<a name="line155"><font color="#000000">155:</font></a> to coordinate; the independently-written parts would not work together.
<a name="line156"><font color="#000000">156:</font></a> But for the particular task of replacing Unix, this problem is absent.  A
<a name="line157"><font color="#000000">157:</font></a> complete Unix system contains hundreds of utility programs, each of which
<a name="line158"><font color="#000000">158:</font></a> is documented separately.  Most interface specifications are fixed by Unix
<a name="line159"><font color="#000000">159:</font></a> compatibility.  If each contributor can write a compatible replacement for
<a name="line160"><font color="#000000">160:</font></a> a single Unix utility, and make it work properly in place of the original
<a name="line161"><font color="#000000">161:</font></a> on a Unix system, then these utilities will work right when put together.
<a name="line162"><font color="#000000">162:</font></a> Even allowing for Murphy to create a few unexpected problems, assembling
<a name="line163"><font color="#000000">163:</font></a> these components will be a feasible task.  (The kernel will require closer
<a name="line164"><font color="#000000">164:</font></a> communication and will be worked on by a small, tight group.)

<a name="line384"><font color="#000000">384:</font></a> (such as lawyers) say that there is no intrinsic right to intellectual
<a name="line385"><font color="#000000">385:</font></a> property.  The kinds of supposed intellectual property rights that the
<a name="line386"><font color="#000000">386:</font></a> government recognizes were created by specific acts of legislation for
<a name="line387"><font color="#000000">387:</font></a> specific purposes.
<a name="line388"><font color="#000000">388:</font></a> 
<a name="line389"><font color="#000000">389:</font></a> For example, the patent system was established to encourage inventors to
<a name="line390"><font color="#000000">390:</font></a> disclose the details of their inventions.  Its purpose was to help society
<a name="line391"><font color="#000000">391:</font></a> rather than to help inventors.  At the time, the life span of 17 years for
<a name="line392"><font color="#000000">392:</font></a> a patent was short compared with the rate of advance of the state of the
<a name="line393"><font color="#000000">393:</font></a> art.  Since patents are an issue only among manufacturers, for whom the
<a name="line394"><font color="#000000">394:</font></a> cost and effort of a license agreement are small compared with setting up
<a name="line395"><font color="#000000">395:</font></a> production, the patents often do not do much harm.  They do not obstruct
<a name="line396"><font color="#000000">396:</font></a> most individuals who use patented products.
<a name="line397"><font color="#000000">397:</font></a> 
<a name="line398"><font color="#000000">398:</font></a> The idea of copyright did not exist in ancient times, when authors
<a name="line399"><font color="#000000">399:</font></a> frequently copied other authors at length in works of non-fiction.  This
<a name="line400"><font color="#000000">400:</font></a> practice was useful, and is the only way many authors' works have survived
<a name="line401"><font color="#000000">401:</font></a> even in part.  The copyright system was created expressly for the purpose
<a name="line402"><font color="#000000">402:</font></a> of encouraging authorship.  In the domain for which it was
<a name="line403"><font color="#000000">403:</font></a> invented---books, which could be copied economically only on a printing
<a name="line404"><font color="#000000">404:</font></a> press---it did little harm, and did not obstruct most of the individuals
<a name="line405"><font color="#000000">405:</font></a> who read the books.
<a name="line406"><font color="#000000">406:</font></a> 
<a name="line407"><font color="#000000">407:</font></a> All intellectual property rights are just licenses granted by society
<a name="line408"><font color="#000000">408:</font></a> because it was thought, rightly or wrongly, that society as a whole would
<a name="line409"><font color="#000000">409:</font></a> benefit by granting them.  But in any particular situation, we have to ask:
<a name="line410"><font color="#000000">410:</font></a> are we really better off granting such license?  What kind of act are we
<a name="line411"><font color="#000000">411:</font></a> licensing a person to do?
<a name="line412"><font color="#000000">412:</font></a> 
<a name="line413"><font color="#000000">413:</font></a> The case of programs today is very different from that of books a hundred
<a name="line414"><font color="#000000">414:</font></a> years ago.  The fact that the easiest way to copy a program is from one
<a name="line415"><font color="#000000">415:</font></a> neighbor to another, the fact that a program has both source code and
<a name="line416"><font color="#000000">416:</font></a> object code which are distinct, and the fact that a program is used rather
<a name="line417"><font color="#000000">417:</font></a> than read and enjoyed, combine to create a situation in which a person who
<a name="line418"><font color="#000000">418:</font></a> enforces a copyright is harming society as a whole both materially and
<a name="line419"><font color="#000000">419:</font></a> spiritually; in which a person should not do so regardless of whether the
<a name="line420"><font color="#000000">420:</font></a> law enables him to.

<a name="line451"><font color="#000000">451:</font></a> the right question is, will anyone program with a reduced monetary
<a name="line452"><font color="#000000">452:</font></a> incentive?  My experience shows that they will.
<a name="line453"><font color="#000000">453:</font></a> 
<a name="line454"><font color="#000000">454:</font></a> For more than ten years, many of the world's best programmers worked at the

<a name="line456"><font color="#000000">456:</font></a> anywhere else.  They got many kinds of non-monetary rewards: fame and
<a name="line457"><font color="#000000">457:</font></a> appreciation, for example.  And creativity is also fun, a reward in itself.
<a name="line458"><font color="#000000">458:</font></a> 
<a name="line459"><font color="#000000">459:</font></a> Then most of them left when offered a chance to do the same interesting

<a name="line461"><font color="#000000">461:</font></a> 
<a name="line462"><font color="#000000">462:</font></a> What the facts show is that people will program for reasons other than
<a name="line463"><font color="#000000">463:</font></a> riches; but if given a chance to make a lot of money as well, they will
<a name="line464"><font color="#000000">464:</font></a> come to expect and demand it.  Low-paying organizations do poorly in
<a name="line465"><font color="#000000">465:</font></a> competition with high-paying ones, but they do not have to do badly if the
