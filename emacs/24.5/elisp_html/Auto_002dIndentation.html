<h3 class="section">22.7 Automatic Indentation of code</h3>

<p>For programming languages, an important feature of a major mode is to
provide automatic indentation.  There are two parts: one is to decide what
is the right indentation of a line, and the other is to decide when to
reindent a line.  By default, Emacs reindents a line whenever you type a
character in <code>electric-indent-chars</code>, which by default only includes
Newline.  Major modes can add chars to <code>electric-indent-chars</code>
according to the syntax of the language.
</p>
<p>Deciding what is the right indentation is controlled in Emacs by
<code>indent-line-function</code> (see <a href="Mode_002dSpecific-Indent.html#Mode_002dSpecific-Indent">Mode-Specific Indent</a>).  For some modes,
the <em>right</em> indentation cannot be known reliably, typically because
indentation is significant so several indentations are valid but with
different meanings.  In that case, the mode should set
<code>electric-indent-inhibit</code> to make sure the line is not constantly
re-indented against the user&rsquo;s wishes.
</p>
<p>Writing a good indentation function can be difficult and to a large extent
it is still a black art.  Many major mode authors will start by writing a
simple indentation function that works for simple cases, for example by
comparing with the indentation of the previous text line.  For most
programming languages that are not really line-based, this tends to scale
very poorly: improving such a function to let it handle more diverse
situations tends to become more and more difficult, resulting in the end
with a large, complex, unmaintainable indentation function which nobody
dares to touch.
</p>
<p>A good indentation function will usually need to actually parse the text,
according to the syntax of the language.  Luckily, it is not necessary to
parse the text in as much detail as would be needed for a compiler, but on
the other hand, the parser embedded in the indentation code will want to be
somewhat friendly to syntactically incorrect code.
</p>
<p>Good maintainable indentation functions usually fall into two categories:
either parsing forward from some &ldquo;safe&rdquo; starting point until the position
of interest, or parsing backward from the position of interest.  Neither of
the two is a clearly better choice than the other: parsing backward is often
more difficult than parsing forward because programming languages are
designed to be parsed forward, but for the purpose of indentation it has the
advantage of not needing to guess a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; starting point, and it
generally enjoys the property that only a minimum of text will be analyzed
to decide the indentation of a line, so indentation will tend to be less
affected by syntax errors in some earlier unrelated piece of code.  Parsing
forward on the other hand is usually easier and has the advantage of making
it possible to reindent efficiently a whole region at a time, with a single
parse.
</p>
<p>Rather than write your own indentation function from scratch, it is often
preferable to try and reuse some existing ones or to rely on a generic
indentation engine.  There are sadly few such engines.  The CC-mode
indentation code (used with C, C++, Java, Awk and a few other such modes)
has been made more generic over the years, so if your language seems
somewhat similar to one of those languages, you might try to use that
engine.  Another one is SMIE which takes an approach in the spirit of Lisp
sexps and adapts it to non-Lisp languages.
