<h3 class="section">28.9 Input Focus</h3>
<a name="index-input-focus"></a>

<p>At any time, one frame in Emacs is the <em>selected frame</em>.  The selected
window always resides on the selected frame.
</p>
<p>When Emacs displays its frames on several terminals (see <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>), each terminal has its own selected frame.  But only one
of these is &ldquo;<em>the</em> selected frame&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s the frame that belongs
to the terminal from which the most recent input came.  That is, when
Emacs runs a command that came from a certain terminal, the selected
frame is the one of that terminal.  Since Emacs runs only a single
command at any given time, it needs to consider only one selected
frame at a time; this frame is what we call <em>the selected frame</em>
in this manual.  The display on which the selected frame is shown is
the <em>selected frame&rsquo;s display</em>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-selected_002dframe"></a>Function: <strong>selected-frame</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the selected frame.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Some window systems and window managers direct keyboard input to the
window object that the mouse is in; others require explicit clicks or
commands to <em>shift the focus</em> to various window objects.  Either
way, Emacs automatically keeps track of which frame has the focus.  To
explicitly switch to a different frame from a Lisp function, call
<code>select-frame-set-input-focus</code>.
</p>
<p>Lisp programs can also switch frames &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; by calling the
function <code>select-frame</code>.  This does not alter the window system&rsquo;s
concept of focus; rather, it escapes from the window manager&rsquo;s control
until that control is somehow reasserted.
</p>
<p>When using a text terminal, only one frame can be displayed at a time
on the terminal, so after a call to <code>select-frame</code>, the next
redisplay actually displays the newly selected frame.  This frame
remains selected until a subsequent call to <code>select-frame</code>.  Each
frame on a text terminal has a number which appears in the mode line
before the buffer name (see <a href="Mode-Line-Variables.html#Mode-Line-Variables">Mode Line Variables</a>).
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-select_002dframe_002dset_002dinput_002dfocus"></a>Function: <strong>select-frame-set-input-focus</strong> <em>frame &amp;optional norecord</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function selects <var>frame</var>, raises it (should it happen to be
obscured by other frames) and tries to give it the X server&rsquo;s focus.
On a text terminal, the next redisplay displays the new frame on the
entire terminal screen.  The optional argument <var>norecord</var> has the
same meaning as for <code>select-frame</code> (see below).  The return value
of this function is not significant.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-select_002dframe"></a>Command: <strong>select-frame</strong> <em>frame &amp;optional norecord</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function selects frame <var>frame</var>, temporarily disregarding the
focus of the X server if any.  The selection of <var>frame</var> lasts until
the next time the user does something to select a different frame, or
until the next time this function is called.  (If you are using a
window system, the previously selected frame may be restored as the
selected frame after return to the command loop, because it still may
have the window system&rsquo;s input focus.)
</p>
<p>The specified <var>frame</var> becomes the selected frame, and its terminal
becomes the selected terminal.  This function then calls
<code>select-window</code> as a subroutine, passing the window selected
within <var>frame</var> as its first argument and <var>norecord</var> as its
second argument (hence, if <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this
avoids changing the order of recently selected windows nor the buffer
list).  See <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>.
</p>
<p>This function returns <var>frame</var>, or <code>nil</code> if <var>frame</var> has
been deleted.
</p>
<p>In general, you should never use <code>select-frame</code> in a way that
could switch to a different terminal without switching back when
you&rsquo;re done.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Emacs cooperates with the window system by arranging to select frames as
the server and window manager request.  It does so by generating a
special kind of input event, called a <em>focus</em> event, when
appropriate.  The command loop handles a focus event by calling
<code>handle-switch-frame</code>.  See <a href="Focus-Events.html#Focus-Events">Focus Events</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-handle_002dswitch_002dframe"></a>Command: <strong>handle-switch-frame</strong> <em>frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function handles a focus event by selecting frame <var>frame</var>.
</p>
<p>Focus events normally do their job by invoking this command.
Don&rsquo;t call it for any other reason.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-redirect_002dframe_002dfocus"></a>Function: <strong>redirect-frame-focus</strong> <em>frame &amp;optional focus-frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function redirects focus from <var>frame</var> to <var>focus-frame</var>.
This means that <var>focus-frame</var> will receive subsequent keystrokes and
events intended for <var>frame</var>.  After such an event, the value of
<code>last-event-frame</code> will be <var>focus-frame</var>.  Also, switch-frame
events specifying <var>frame</var> will instead select <var>focus-frame</var>.
</p>
<p>If <var>focus-frame</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, that cancels any existing
redirection for <var>frame</var>, which therefore once again receives its own
events.
</p>
<p>One use of focus redirection is for frames that don&rsquo;t have minibuffers.
These frames use minibuffers on other frames.  Activating a minibuffer
on another frame redirects focus to that frame.  This puts the focus on
the minibuffer&rsquo;s frame, where it belongs, even though the mouse remains
in the frame that activated the minibuffer.
</p>
<p>Selecting a frame can also change focus redirections.  Selecting frame
<code>bar</code>, when <code>foo</code> had been selected, changes any redirections
pointing to <code>foo</code> so that they point to <code>bar</code> instead.  This
allows focus redirection to work properly when the user switches from
one frame to another using <code>select-window</code>.
</p>
<p>This means that a frame whose focus is redirected to itself is treated
differently from a frame whose focus is not redirected.
<code>select-frame</code> affects the former but not the latter.
</p>
<p>The redirection lasts until <code>redirect-frame-focus</code> is called to
change it.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-focus_002din_002dhook"></a>Variable: <strong>focus-in-hook</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a normal hook run when an Emacs frame gains input focus.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-focus_002dout_002dhook"></a>Variable: <strong>focus-out-hook</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a normal hook run when an Emacs frame loses input focus.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-focus_002dfollows_002dmouse"></a>User Option: <strong>focus-follows-mouse</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This option is how you inform Emacs whether the window manager transfers
focus when the user moves the mouse.  Non-<code>nil</code> says that it does.
When this is so, the command <code>other-frame</code> moves the mouse to a
position consistent with the new selected frame.
