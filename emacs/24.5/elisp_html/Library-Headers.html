<h3 class="section">D.8 Conventional Headers for Emacs Libraries</h3>
<a name="index-header-comments"></a>
<a name="index-library-header-comments"></a>

<p>Emacs has conventions for using special comments in Lisp libraries
to divide them into sections and give information such as who wrote
them.  Using a standard format for these items makes it easier for
tools (and people) to extract the relevant information.  This section
explains these conventions, starting with an example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">;;; foo.el --- Support for the Foo programming language

;; Copyright (C) 2010-2015 Your Name
</pre><pre class="smallexample">

;; Author: Your Name &lt;yourname@example.com&gt;
;; Maintainer: Someone Else &lt;someone@example.com&gt;
;; Created: 14 Jul 2010
</pre><pre class="smallexample">;; Keywords: languages
;; Homepage: http://example.com/foo

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;; This file is free software&hellip;
&hellip;
;; along with this file.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
</pre></div>

<p>The very first line should have this format:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;;; <var>filename</var> --- <var>description</var>
</pre></div>

<p>The description should be contained in one line.  If the file
needs a &lsquo;<samp>-*-</samp>&rsquo; specification, put it after <var>description</var>.
If this would make the first line too long, use a Local Variables
section at the end of the file.
</p>
<p>The copyright notice usually lists your name (if you wrote the
file).  If you have an employer who claims copyright on your work, you
might need to list them instead.  Do not say that the copyright holder
is the Free Software Foundation (or that the file is part of GNU
Emacs) unless your file has been accepted into the Emacs distribution.
For more information on the form of copyright and license notices, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html">the guide on the GNU
website</a>.
</p>
<p>After the copyright notice come several <em>header comment</em> lines,
each beginning with &lsquo;<samp>;; <var>header-name</var>:</samp>&rsquo;.  Here is a table of
the conventional possibilities for <var>header-name</var>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Author</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This line states the name and email address of at least the principal
author of the library.  If there are multiple authors, list them on
continuation lines led by <code>;;</code> and a tab or at least two spaces.
We recommend including a contact email address, of the form
&lsquo;<samp>&lt;&hellip;&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">;; Author: Your Name &lt;yourname@example.com&gt;
;;      Someone Else &lt;someone@example.com&gt;
;;      Another Person &lt;another@example.com&gt;
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Maintainer</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This header has the same format as the Author header.  It lists the
person(s) who currently maintain(s) the file (respond to bug reports,
etc.).
</p>
<p>If there is no maintainer line, the person(s) in the Author field
is/are presumed to be the maintainers.  Some files in Emacs use
&lsquo;<samp>FSF</samp>&rsquo; for the maintainer.  This means that the original author is
no longer responsible for the file, and that it is maintained as part
of Emacs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Created</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This optional line gives the original creation date of the file, and
is for historical interest only.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Version</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>If you wish to record version numbers for the individual Lisp program,
put them in this line.  Lisp files distributed with Emacs generally do
not have a &lsquo;<samp>Version</samp>&rsquo; header, since the version number of Emacs
itself serves the same purpose.  If you are distributing a collection
of multiple files, we recommend not writing the version in every file,
but only the main one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Keywords</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This line lists keywords for the <code>finder-by-keyword</code> help command.
Please use that command to see a list of the meaningful keywords.
</p>
<p>This field is how people will find your package when they&rsquo;re looking
for things by topic.  To separate the keywords, you can use spaces,
commas, or both.
</p>
<p>The name of this field is unfortunate, since people often assume it is
the place to write arbitrary keywords that describe their package,
rather than just the relevant Finder keywords.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Homepage</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This line states the homepage of the library.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Package-Version</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>If &lsquo;<samp>Version</samp>&rsquo; is not suitable for use by the package manager, then
a package can define &lsquo;<samp>Package-Version</samp>&rsquo;; it will be used instead.
This is handy if &lsquo;<samp>Version</samp>&rsquo; is an RCS id or something else that
cannot be parsed by <code>version-to-list</code>.  See <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>Package-Requires</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>If this exists, it names packages on which the current package depends
for proper operation.  See <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>.  This is used by the
package manager both at download time (to ensure that a complete set
of packages is downloaded) and at activation time (to ensure that a
package is only activated if all its dependencies have been).
</p>
<p>Its format is a list of lists.  The <code>car</code> of each sub-list is the
name of a package, as a symbol.  The <code>cadr</code> of each sub-list is
the minimum acceptable version number, as a string.  For instance:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">;; Package-Requires: ((gnus &quot;1.0&quot;) (bubbles &quot;2.7.2&quot;))
</pre></div>

<p>The package code automatically defines a package named &lsquo;<samp>emacs</samp>&rsquo;
with the version number of the currently running Emacs.  This can be
used to require a minimal version of Emacs for a package.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Just about every Lisp library ought to have the &lsquo;<samp>Author</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>Keywords</samp>&rsquo; header comment lines.  Use the others if they are
appropriate.  You can also put in header lines with other header
names&mdash;they have no standard meanings, so they can&rsquo;t do any harm.
</p>
<p>We use additional stylized comments to subdivide the contents of the
library file.  These should be separated from anything else by blank
lines.  Here is a table of them:
</p>
<a name="index-commentary_002c-in-a-Lisp-library"></a>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>;;; Commentary:</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This begins introductory comments that explain how the library works.
It should come right after the copying permissions, terminated by a
&lsquo;<samp>Change Log</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>History</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>Code</samp>&rsquo; comment line.  This
text is used by the Finder package, so it should make sense in that
context.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>;;; Change Log:</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This begins an optional log of changes to the file over time.  Don&rsquo;t
put too much information in this section&mdash;it is better to keep the
detailed logs in a version control system (as Emacs does) or in a
separate <samp>ChangeLog</samp> file.  &lsquo;<samp>History</samp>&rsquo; is an alternative to
&lsquo;<samp>Change Log</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>;;; Code:</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This begins the actual code of the program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>;;; <var>filename</var> ends here</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This is the <em>footer line</em>; it appears at the very end of the file.
Its purpose is to enable people to detect truncated versions of the file
from the lack of a footer line.
</p></dd>
</dl>
