<a name="index-current-buffer"></a>

<p>There are, in general, many buffers in an Emacs session.  At any
time, one of them is designated the <em>current buffer</em>&mdash;the buffer
in which most editing takes place.  Most of the primitives for
examining or changing text operate implicitly on the current buffer
(see <a href="Text.html#Text">Text</a>).
</p>
<p>Normally, the buffer displayed in the selected window is the current
buffer, but this is not always so: a Lisp program can temporarily
designate any buffer as current in order to operate on its contents,
without changing what is displayed on the screen.  The most basic
function for designating a current buffer is <code>set-buffer</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-current_002dbuffer"></a>Function: <strong>current-buffer</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the current buffer.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(current-buffer)
     &rArr; #&lt;buffer buffers.texi&gt;
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-set_002dbuffer"></a>Function: <strong>set-buffer</strong> <em>buffer-or-name</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function makes <var>buffer-or-name</var> the current buffer.
<var>buffer-or-name</var> must be an existing buffer or the name of an
existing buffer.  The return value is the buffer made current.
</p>
<p>This function does not display the buffer in any window, so the user
cannot necessarily see the buffer.  But Lisp programs will now operate
on it.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>When an editing command returns to the editor command loop, Emacs
automatically calls <code>set-buffer</code> on the buffer shown in the
selected window.  This is to prevent confusion: it ensures that the
buffer that the cursor is in, when Emacs reads a command, is the
buffer to which that command applies (see <a href="Command-Loop.html#Command-Loop">Command Loop</a>).  Thus,
you should not use <code>set-buffer</code> to switch visibly to a different
buffer; for that, use the functions described in <a href="Switching-Buffers.html#Switching-Buffers">Switching Buffers</a>.
</p>
<p>When writing a Lisp function, do <em>not</em> rely on this behavior of
the command loop to restore the current buffer after an operation.
Editing commands can also be called as Lisp functions by other
programs, not just from the command loop; it is convenient for the
caller if the subroutine does not change which buffer is current
(unless, of course, that is the subroutine&rsquo;s purpose).
</p>
<p>To operate temporarily on another buffer, put the <code>set-buffer</code>
within a <code>save-current-buffer</code> form.  Here, as an example, is a
simplified version of the command <code>append-to-buffer</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun append-to-buffer (buffer start end)
  &quot;Append the text of the region to BUFFER.&quot;
  (interactive &quot;BAppend to buffer: \nr&quot;)
  (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
    (save-current-buffer
      (set-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer))
      (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))
</pre></div>

<p>Here, we bind a local variable to record the current buffer, and then
<code>save-current-buffer</code> arranges to make it current again later.
Next, <code>set-buffer</code> makes the specified buffer current, and
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> copies the string from the original
buffer to the specified (and now current) buffer.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can use the <code>with-current-buffer</code> macro:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun append-to-buffer (buffer start end)
  &quot;Append the text of the region to BUFFER.&quot;
  (interactive &quot;BAppend to buffer: \nr&quot;)
  (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer)
      (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))
</pre></div>

<p>In either case, if the buffer appended to happens to be displayed in
some window, the next redisplay will show how its text has changed.
If it is not displayed in any window, you will not see the change
immediately on the screen.  The command causes the buffer to become
current temporarily, but does not cause it to be displayed.
</p>
<p>If you make local bindings (with <code>let</code> or function arguments)
for a variable that may also have buffer-local bindings, make sure
that the same buffer is current at the beginning and at the end of the
local binding&rsquo;s scope.  Otherwise you might bind it in one buffer and
unbind it in another!
</p>
<p>Do not rely on using <code>set-buffer</code> to change the current buffer
back, because that won&rsquo;t do the job if a quit happens while the wrong
buffer is current.  For instance, in the previous example, it would
have been wrong to do this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
    (set-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer))
    (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)
    (set-buffer oldbuf))
</pre></div>

<p>Using <code>save-current-buffer</code> or <code>with-current-buffer</code>, as we
did, correctly handles quitting, errors, and <code>throw</code>, as well as
ordinary evaluation.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-save_002dcurrent_002dbuffer"></a>Special Form: <strong>save-current-buffer</strong> <em>body&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>save-current-buffer</code> special form saves the identity of the
current buffer, evaluates the <var>body</var> forms, and finally restores
that buffer as current.  The return value is the value of the last
form in <var>body</var>.  The current buffer is restored even in case of an
abnormal exit via <code>throw</code> or error (see <a href="Nonlocal-Exits.html#Nonlocal-Exits">Nonlocal Exits</a>).
</p>
<p>If the buffer that used to be current has been killed by the time of
exit from <code>save-current-buffer</code>, then it is not made current again,
of course.  Instead, whichever buffer was current just before exit
remains current.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-with_002dcurrent_002dbuffer"></a>Macro: <strong>with-current-buffer</strong> <em>buffer-or-name body&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>with-current-buffer</code> macro saves the identity of the current
buffer, makes <var>buffer-or-name</var> current, evaluates the <var>body</var>
forms, and finally restores the current buffer.  <var>buffer-or-name</var>
must specify an existing buffer or the name of an existing buffer.
</p>
<p>The return value is the value of the last form in <var>body</var>.  The
current buffer is restored even in case of an abnormal exit via
<code>throw</code> or error (see <a href="Nonlocal-Exits.html#Nonlocal-Exits">Nonlocal Exits</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-with_002dtemp_002dbuffer"></a>Macro: <strong>with-temp-buffer</strong> <em>body&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><a name="Definition-of-with_002dtemp_002dbuffer"></a><p>The <code>with-temp-buffer</code> macro evaluates the <var>body</var> forms
with a temporary buffer as the current buffer.  It saves the identity of
the current buffer, creates a temporary buffer and makes it current,
evaluates the <var>body</var> forms, and finally restores the previous
current buffer while killing the temporary buffer.  By default, undo
information (see <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>) is not recorded in the buffer created by
this macro (but <var>body</var> can enable that, if needed).
</p>
<p>The return value is the value of the last form in <var>body</var>.  You can
return the contents of the temporary buffer by using
<code>(buffer-string)</code> as the last form.
</p>
<p>The current buffer is restored even in case of an abnormal exit via
<code>throw</code> or error (see <a href="Nonlocal-Exits.html#Nonlocal-Exits">Nonlocal Exits</a>).
