<a name="How-Many-Times-is-the-Macro-Expanded_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">14.5.5 How Many Times is the Macro Expanded?</h4>

<p>Occasionally problems result from the fact that a macro call is
expanded each time it is evaluated in an interpreted function, but is
expanded only once (during compilation) for a compiled function.  If the
macro definition has side effects, they will work differently depending
on how many times the macro is expanded.
</p>
<p>Therefore, you should avoid side effects in computation of the
macro expansion, unless you really know what you are doing.
</p>
<p>One special kind of side effect can&rsquo;t be avoided: constructing Lisp
objects.  Almost all macro expansions include constructed lists; that is
the whole point of most macros.  This is usually safe; there is just one
case where you must be careful: when the object you construct is part of a
quoted constant in the macro expansion.
</p>
<p>If the macro is expanded just once, in compilation, then the object is
constructed just once, during compilation.  But in interpreted
execution, the macro is expanded each time the macro call runs, and this
means a new object is constructed each time.
</p>
<p>In most clean Lisp code, this difference won&rsquo;t matter.  It can matter
only if you perform side-effects on the objects constructed by the macro
definition.  Thus, to avoid trouble, <strong>avoid side effects on
objects constructed by macro definitions</strong>.  Here is an example of how
such side effects can get you into trouble:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(defmacro empty-object ()
  (list 'quote (cons nil nil)))
</pre><pre class="lisp">

</pre><pre class="lisp">(defun initialize (condition)
  (let ((object (empty-object)))
    (if condition
        (setcar object condition))
    object))
</pre></div>

<p>If <code>initialize</code> is interpreted, a new list <code>(nil)</code> is
constructed each time <code>initialize</code> is called.  Thus, no side effect
survives between calls.  If <code>initialize</code> is compiled, then the
macro <code>empty-object</code> is expanded during compilation, producing a
single constant <code>(nil)</code> that is reused and altered each time
<code>initialize</code> is called.
</p>
<p>One way to avoid pathological cases like this is to think of
<code>empty-object</code> as a funny kind of constant, not as a memory
allocation construct.  You wouldn&rsquo;t use <code>setcar</code> on a constant such
as <code>'(nil)</code>, so naturally you won&rsquo;t use it on <code>(empty-object)</code>
either.
