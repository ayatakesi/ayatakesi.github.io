<a name="Introduction-to-Minibuffers"></a>
<h3 class="section">20.1 Introduction to Minibuffers</h3>

<p>In most ways, a minibuffer is a normal Emacs buffer.  Most operations
<em>within</em> a buffer, such as editing commands, work normally in a
minibuffer.  However, many operations for managing buffers do not apply
to minibuffers.  The name of a minibuffer always has the form &lsquo;<samp>&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">*Minibuf-</span><var>number</var>*</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, and it cannot be changed.  Minibuffers are
displayed only in special windows used only for minibuffers; these
windows always appear at the bottom of a frame.  (Sometimes frames have
no minibuffer window, and sometimes a special kind of frame contains
nothing but a minibuffer window; see <a href="Minibuffers-and-Frames.html#Minibuffers-and-Frames">Minibuffers and Frames</a>.)
</p>
<p>The text in the minibuffer always starts with the <em>prompt string</em>,
the text that was specified by the program that is using the minibuffer
to tell the user what sort of input to type.  This text is marked
read-only so you won&rsquo;t accidentally delete or change it.  It is also
marked as a field (see <a href="Fields.html#Fields">Fields</a>), so that certain motion functions,
including <code>beginning-of-line</code>, <code>forward-word</code>,
<code>forward-sentence</code>, and <code>forward-paragraph</code>, stop at the
boundary between the prompt and the actual text.
</p>
<p>The minibuffer&rsquo;s window is normally a single line; it grows
automatically if the contents require more space.  Whilst the minibuffer
is active, you can explicitly resize its window temporarily with the
window sizing commands; the window reverts to its normal size when the
minibuffer is exited.  When the minibuffer is not active, you can resize
its window permanently by using the window sizing commands in the
frame&rsquo;s other window, or dragging the mode line with the mouse.  (Due to
details of the current implementation, for this to work
<code>resize-mini-windows</code> must be <code>nil</code>.)  If the frame contains
just a minibuffer window, you can change its size by changing the
frame&rsquo;s size.
</p>
<p>Use of the minibuffer reads input events, and that alters the values
of variables such as <code>this-command</code> and <code>last-command</code>
(see <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>).  Your program should bind them around the
code that uses the minibuffer, if you do not want that to change them.
</p>
<p>Under some circumstances, a command can use a minibuffer even if
there is an active minibuffer; such a minibuffer is called a
<em>recursive minibuffer</em>.  The first minibuffer is named
&lsquo;<samp>&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">*Minibuf-1*</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  Recursive minibuffers are named by
incrementing the number at the end of the name.  (The names begin with
a space so that they won&rsquo;t show up in normal buffer lists.)  Of
several recursive minibuffers, the innermost (or most recently
entered) is the active minibuffer.  We usually call this <em>the</em>
minibuffer.  You can permit or forbid recursive minibuffers by setting
the variable <code>enable-recursive-minibuffers</code>, or by putting
properties of that name on command symbols (See <a href="Recursive-Mini.html#Recursive-Mini">Recursive Mini</a>.)
</p>
<p>Like other buffers, a minibuffer uses a local keymap
(see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>) to specify special key bindings.  The function that
invokes the minibuffer also sets up its local map according to the job
to be done.  See <a href="Text-from-Minibuffer.html#Text-from-Minibuffer">Text from Minibuffer</a>, for the non-completion
minibuffer local maps.  See <a href="Completion-Commands.html#Completion-Commands">Completion Commands</a>, for the minibuffer
local maps for completion.
</p>
<a name="index-inactive-minibuffer"></a>
<p>When a minibuffer is inactive, its major mode is
<code>minibuffer-inactive-mode</code>, with keymap
<code>minibuffer-inactive-mode-map</code>.  This is only really useful if
the minibuffer is in a separate frame.  See <a href="Minibuffers-and-Frames.html#Minibuffers-and-Frames">Minibuffers and Frames</a>.
</p>
<p>When Emacs is running in batch mode, any request to read from the
minibuffer actually reads a line from the standard input descriptor that
was supplied when Emacs was started.  This supports only basic input:
none of the special minibuffer features (history, completion, etc.)
are available in batch mode.
