<h2 class="unnumbered">Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Many people have contributed code included in the Free Software
Foundation&rsquo;s distribution of GNU Emacs.  To show our appreciation for
their public spirit, we list here in alphabetical order those who have
written substantial portions.  Others too numerous to mention have
reported and fixed bugs, and added features to many parts of Emacs.
We thank them for their generosity as well.
</p>
<p>This list is intended to mention every contributor of a major package or
feature we currently distribute; if you know of someone we have omitted,
please make a bug report.  More comprehensive information is
available in the <samp>ChangeLog</samp> files, summarized in the file
