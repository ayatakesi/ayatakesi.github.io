Other commands do the same as @code{display-buffer}, and additionally select the displaying window so that you can begin editing its buffer.  The command <del>@kbd{C-x `}</del> <ins>@kbd{M-g M-n}</ins> (@code{next-error}) is one example (@pxref{Compilation Mode}).  Such commands work by calling the function @code{pop-to-buffer} internally.  @xref{Switching Buffers,,Switching to a Buffer in a Window, elisp, The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual}.
