This event occurs when a user drags an object from another application into an Emacs frame.  The default behavior is to open a file in the window under the mouse, or to insert text at point of the window under the mouse.  <del>It may sometimes be necessary to use the @key{Meta} key in conjunction with dragging to force text insertion.</del>
