@kbd{M-x <del>next-file}</del> <ins>tags-next-file}</ins> visits files covered by the selected tags table.  The first time it is called, it visits the first file covered by the table.  Each subsequent call visits the next covered file, unless a prefix argument is supplied, in which case it returns to the first file.  This command requires a tags table to be selected.
