<span id="Using-Emacs-on-Touchscreens"></span><h3 class="section">J.1 Using Emacs on Touchscreens</h3>
<span id="index-touchscreen-input"></span>

<p>Touchscreen input works by pressing and moving tools (which include fingers
and some pointing devices&ndash;styluses, for example) onto a frame in order to
manipulate its contents.
</p>
<p>When running under the X Window System or Android, Emacs automatically
detects and maps the following sequences of movements (&ldquo;gestures&rdquo;) to
common actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <span id="index-tapping_002c-touchscreens"></span>
&ldquo;Tapping&rdquo;, briefly placing and lifting a tool from the display, will
result in Emacs selecting the window that was tapped, and executing any
command bound to <code>mouse-1</code> at that location in the window.  If the tap
happened on top of a link (see <a href="Mouse-References.html">マウスで参照をフォローする</a>), then Emacs will follow
the link instead.

<p>If a command bound to <code>down-mouse-1</code> is bound to the location where the
tap took place, Emacs will execute that command as well.
</p>
</li><li> <span id="index-scrolling_002c-touchscreens"></span>
&ldquo;Scrolling&rdquo;, meaning to place a tool on the display and move it up or
down, will result in Emacs scrolling the window contents in the direction
where the tool moves.

<p>If the tool is moved left or right, Emacs additionally scrolls the window
horizontally to follow (see <a href="Horizontal-Scrolling.html">水平スクロール</a>.)
</p>
</li><li> <span id="index-dragging_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<span id="index-long_002dpress_002c-touchscreens"></span>
&ldquo;Dragging&rdquo;, which is performing a <em>long-press</em> by placing a tool on
the display and leaving it there for a while prior to moving the tool around
will make Emacs set the point to where the tool was and begin selecting text
under the tool as it moves around, as if <code>mouse-1</code> were to be held
down.  See <a href="Mouse-Commands.html">編集のためのマウスコマンド</a>.

<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dword_002dselect"></span>
<span id="index-word-selection-mode_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<p>Some people find it difficult to position a tool accurately on a touch
screen display, to the detriment of text selection.  The user option
<code>touch-screen-word-select</code> enables &ldquo;word selection mode&rdquo;, causing
dragging to select the complete word, not only the character containing the
position of the tool.
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dextend_002dselection"></span>
<span id="index-extending-the-selection_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<p>Similarly, it may be difficult to select all of the text intended within a
single gesture.  If the user option <code>touch-screen-extend-selection</code> is
enabled, taps on the locations of the point or the mark within a window will
begin a new &ldquo;drag&rdquo; gesture, where the region will be extended in the
direction of any subsequent movement.
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dpreview_002dselect"></span>
<span id="index-previewing-the-region-during-selection_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<p>Difficulties in making accurate adjustments to the region can also be
alleviated by indicating the position of the point relative to its
containing line within the echo area, since the window cursor may be
physically obscured by the tool.  If <code>touch-screen-preview-select</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the line containing point is displayed in the echo area
(see <a href="Echo-Area.html">エコーエリア</a>)  during the motion of the tool, followed by another line
indicating the position of point within the first line.
</p></li></ul>

<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002ddelay"></span>
<p>By default, Emacs considers a tool as having been left on the display long
enough to trigger a &ldquo;long-press&rdquo; after 0.7 seconds, but this can be
changed by customizing the variable <code>touch-screen-delay</code>.
