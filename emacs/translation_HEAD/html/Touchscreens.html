<span id="Using-Emacs-on-Touchscreens"></span><h3 class="section">6.1 Using Emacs on Touchscreens</h3>
<span id="index-touchscreen-input"></span>

<p>Touchscreen input is the manipulation of a frame&rsquo;s contents by the placement
and motion of tools (instanced by fingers and such pointing devices as
styluses) on a monitor or computer terminal where it is displayed.
</p>
<p>Two factors, the order and position on which such tools are placed, are
compared against predefined patterns dubbed <em>gestures</em>, after which any
gesture those factors align with designates a series of actions to be taken
on the text beneath the tools; the gestures presently recognized are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <span id="index-tapping_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<em>Tapping</em>, briefly placing and lifting a tool from the display, will
select the window that was tapped, and execute any command bound to
<code>mouse-1</code> at that location in the window.  If a link (see <a href="Mouse-References.html">マウスで参照をフォローする</a>) exists there, then Emacs will follow that link instead (insofar
as such action differs from that taken upon the simulation of a
<code>mouse-1</code> event).

</li><li> <span id="index-scrolling_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002denable_002dhscroll"></span>
<em>Scrolling</em>, which is continuous vertical or horizontal motion on the
screen, will scroll the contents of the window beneath the tool&rsquo;s initial
location in the direction of movement.  The user option
<code>touch-screen-enable-hscroll</code> governs whether horizontal scrolling
(see <a href="Horizontal-Scrolling.html">水平スクロール</a>) is performed in reaction to this gesture.

</li><li> <span id="index-dragging_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<span id="index-long_002dpress_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<em>Dragging</em>, which is performing a <em>long-press</em> by placing a tool on
the display and leaving it there awhile before moving it to another
position, will move point to the tool&rsquo;s initial position, and commence
selecting text under the tool as it continues its motion, as if
<code>mouse-1</code> were to be held down and a mouse moved analogously.
See <a href="Mouse-Commands.html">編集のためのマウスコマンド</a>.

<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dword_002dselect"></span>
<span id="index-word-selection-mode_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<p>To the detriment of text selection, it can prove challenging to position a
tool accurately on a touch screen display.  The user option
<code>touch-screen-word-select</code>, which when enabled, prompts dragging to
select the complete word under the tool.  (Normally, the selection is only
extended to encompass the character beneath the tool.)
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dextend_002dselection"></span>
<span id="index-extending-the-selection_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<p>In the same vein, it may be difficult to select all of the text intended
within a single gesture.  If the user option
<code>touch-screen-extend-selection</code> is enabled, taps on the locations of
the point or the mark within a window will begin a new &ldquo;drag&rdquo; gesture,
where the region will be extended in the direction of any subsequent
movement.
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dpreview_002dselect"></span>
<span id="index-previewing-the-region-during-selection_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<p>Difficulties in making accurate adjustments to the region from the cursor
being physically obscured by the tool can be mitigated by indicating the
position of the point within the echo area.  If
<code>touch-screen-preview-select</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the line surrounding
point is displayed in the echo area (see <a href="Echo-Area.html">エコーエリア</a>)  during the motion
of the tool, below which is another line indicating the position of point
relative to the first.
</p>
</li><li> <span id="index-pinching_002c-touchscreens"></span>
<em>Pinching</em>, the placement of two tools apart on the screen followed by
adjustments to their position such as to increase or decrease the distance
between them will modify the text scale (see <a href="Text-Scale.html">テキストのスケール</a>) in proportion
to the change in that distance.
</li></ul>

<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002ddelay"></span>
<p>Emacs registers a long-press after the time a tool has been placed upon the
screen exceeds 0.7 seconds.  This delay can be adjusted through customizing
the variable <code>touch-screen-delay</code>.
