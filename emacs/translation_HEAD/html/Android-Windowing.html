<span id="The-Android-Window-System"></span><h3 class="section">H.6 The Android Window System</h3>

<p>Android has an unusual window system; there, all windows are maximized or
full-screen, and only one window can be displayed at a time.  On larger
devices, the system allows up to four windows to be tiled on the screen at
any time.
</p>
<p>Windows on Android do not continue to exist indefinitely after they are
created.  Instead, the system may choose to close windows that are not on
screen in order to save memory, with the assumption that the program will
save its contents to disk and restore them later, when the user asks for it
to be opened again.  As this is obviously not possible with Emacs, Emacs
separates the resources associated with a frame from its system window.
</p>
<p>Each system window created (including the initial window created during
Emacs startup) is appended to a list of windows that do not have associated
frames.  When a frame is created, Emacs looks up any window within that
list, and displays the contents of the frame within; if there is no window
at all, then one is created.  Likewise, when a new window is created by the
system, Emacs places the contents of any frame that is not already displayed
within a window inside.  When a frame is closed, the corresponding system
window is also closed.  Upon startup, the system creates a window itself
(within which Emacs displays the first window system frame shortly
thereafter.)  Emacs differentiates between that window and windows created
on behalf of other frames to determine what to do when the system window
associated with a frame is closed:
</p>
<ul>
<li> When the system closes the window created during application startup in
order to save memory, Emacs retains the frame for when that window is
created later.

</li><li> When the user closes the window created during application startup, and the
window was not previously closed by the system in order to save resources,
Emacs deletes any frame displayed within that window.

</li><li> When the user or the system closes any window created by Emacs on behalf of
a specific frame, Emacs deletes the frame displayed within that window.
</li></ul>

<span id="index-windowing-limitations_002c-android"></span>
<span id="index-frame-parameters_002c-android"></span>
<p>Emacs only supports a limited subset of GUI features on Android; the
limitations are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Scroll bars are not supported, as they are close to useless on Android
devices.

</li><li> The <code>alpha</code>, <code>alpha-background</code>, <code>z-group</code>,
<code>override-redirect</code>, <code>mouse-color</code>, <code>title</code>,
<code>wait-for-wm</code>, <code>sticky</code>, <code>undecorated</code> and
<code>tool-bar-position</code> frame parameters (see <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Frame-Parameters.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a> in <cite>the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>) are unsupported.

</li><li> On Android 4.0 and earlier, the <code>fullscreen</code> frame parameter is always
<code>maximized</code> for top-level frames; on later versions of Android, it can
also be <code>fullscreen</code>.
</li></ul>

<span id="index-selections_002c-android"></span>
<span id="index-android-clipboard"></span>
<p>Emacs does not implement all selection related features supported under the
X Window System on Android.  For example, only the <code>CLIPBOARD</code> and
<code>PRIMARY</code> selections (see <a href="Cut-and-Paste.html">グラフィカルなディスプレイでのカットアンドペースト</a>)  are supported, and Emacs
is only able to set selections to plain text.
</p>
<p>In addition, the Android system itself places certain restrictions on what
selection data Emacs can access:
</p>
<ul>
<li> On Android 2.3 and earlier, the function <code>gui-selection-owner-p</code> always
returns <code>nil</code> for the clipboard selection.

</li><li> Between Android 3.0 and Android 9.0, Emacs is able to access the clipboard
whenever it wants, and <code>gui-selection-owner-p</code> always returns accurate
results.

</li><li> Under Android 10.0 and later, Emacs can only access clipboard data when one
of its frames has the input focus, and <code>gui-selection-owner-p</code> always
returns <code>nil</code> for the clipboard selection.
</li></ul>

<p>Since the Android system itself has no concept of a primary selection, Emacs
provides an emulation instead.  This means there is no way to transfer the
contents of the primary selection to another application via cut-and-paste.
</p>
<span id="index-android_002dpass_002dmultimedia_002dbuttons_002dto_002dsystem"></span>
<span id="index-volume_002fmultimedia-buttons_002c-Android"></span>
<p>The volume keys are normally reserved by Emacs and used to provide the
ability to quit Emacs without a physical keyboard (see <a href="On_002dScreen-Keyboards.html">Using Emacs with Virtual Keyboards</a>.)  However, if you want them to adjust the volume instead, you
can set the variable <code>android-pass-multimedia-buttons-to-system</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value; note that you will no longer be able to quit Emacs
using the volume buttons in that case.
</p>
<span id="index-dialog-boxes_002c-android"></span>
<p>Emacs is unable to display dialog boxes (see <a href="Dialog-Boxes.html">ダイアログボックスの使用</a>) while it does
not have the input focus on Android 6.0 or later.  If this is important to
you, this ability can be restored by granting Emacs permission to display
over other programs.  Normally, this can be done from the:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">System -&gt; Apps -&gt; Emacs -&gt; More -&gt; Display over other apps
</pre></div>

<p>menu in the system settings, but this procedure may vary by device.
</p>
<span id="index-keyboard-modifiers_002c-android"></span>
<p>There is a direct relation between physical modifier keys and Emacs
modifiers (see <a href="Modifier-Keys.html">修飾キー</a>) reported within key events, subject to a
single exception: if <tt class="key">Alt</tt> on your keyboard is depressed, then the
<tt class="key">Meta</tt> modifier will be reported by Emacs in its place, and vice versa.
This irregularity is since most keyboards posses no special <tt class="key">Meta</tt> key,
and the <tt class="key">Alt</tt> modifier is seldom employed in Emacs.
</p>
<p>Bear in mind that Android uses a different name for the <tt class="key">Super</tt>
modifier: it is referred to as <tt class="key">SYM</tt> on Android keyboards and within the
Settings keymap menu.
</p>
<span id="index-android_002dintercept_002dcontrol_002dspace"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dSPC-interception_002c-android"></span>
<p>Android input methods have a penchant for irritating users by silently
discarding key sequences containing <kbd>C-SPC</kbd> during the event filtering
process, that they normally have no real application for such key sequences
notwithstanding.  By default, Emacs intercepts these key sequences before
they can be filtered by the input method.
</p>
<p>If this proves unwanted (for instance, if the input method treats
<kbd>C-SPC</kbd> as a shortcut key for switching languages), it can be disabled
by setting the variable <code>android-intercept-control-space</code> to
<code>nil</code>.
