<dd><span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dAbbrev"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Abbrev</span></dt>
<dd><p>An abbrev is a text string that expands into a different text string
when present in the buffer.  For example, you might define a few letters
as an abbrev for a long phrase that you want to insert frequently.
See <a href="Abbrevs.html">abbrev(略語)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Aborting</span></dt>
<dd><p>Aborting means getting out of a recursive edit (q.v.).  The
commands <kbd>C-]</kbd> and <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd> are used for this.
See <a href="Quitting.html">中止と中断</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Active Region</span></dt>
<dd><p>Setting the mark (q.v.) at a position in the text also activates it.
When the mark is active, we call the region an active region.
See <a href="Mark.html">マークとリージョン</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><tt class="key">Alt</tt></span></dt>
<dd><p>Alt is the name of a modifier bit that a keyboard input character may
have.  To make a character Alt, type it while holding down the <tt class="key">Alt</tt>
key.  Such characters are given names that start with <kbd><span class="key">Alt</span>-</kbd>
(usually written <kbd>A-</kbd> for short).  (Note that many terminals have a
key labeled <tt class="key">Alt</tt> that is really a <tt class="key">Meta</tt> key.)  See <a href="User-Input.html">Alt</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Argument</span></dt>
<dd><p>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dNumeric-Argument">Glossary---Numeric Argument</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><acronym>ASCII</acronym> character</span></dt>
<dd><p>An <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character is either an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control
character or an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> printing character.  See <a href="User-Input.html">ユーザー入力の種類</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><acronym>ASCII</acronym> control character</span></dt>
<dd><p>An <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control character is the Control version of an upper-case
letter, or the Control version of one of the characters &lsquo;<samp>@[\]^_?</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><acronym>ASCII</acronym> printing character</span></dt>
<dd><p><acronym>ASCII</acronym> letters, digits, space, and the following punctuation
characters: &lsquo;<samp>!@#$%^&amp;*()_-+=|\~`{}[]:;&quot;'&lt;&gt;,.?/</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Auto Fill Mode</span></dt>
<dd><p>Auto Fill mode is a minor mode (q.v.) in which text that you insert is
automatically broken into lines of a given maximum width.
See <a href="Filling.html">テキストのフィル</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Auto Saving</span></dt>
<dd><p>Auto saving is the practice of periodically saving the contents of an
Emacs buffer in a specially-named file, so that the information will
be preserved if the buffer is lost due to a system error or user error.
See <a href="Auto-Save.html">自動保存－災害にたいする防御</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Autoloading</span></dt>
<dd><p>Emacs can automatically load Lisp libraries when a Lisp program requests a
function from those libraries.  This is called &ldquo;autoloading&rdquo;.
See <a href="Lisp-Libraries.html">EmacsのためのLispコードによるライブラリー</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Backtrace</span></dt>
<dd><p>A backtrace is a trace of a series of function calls showing how a
program arrived at a certain point.  It is used mainly for finding and
correcting bugs (q.v.).  Emacs can display a backtrace when it signals
an error or when you type <kbd>C-g</kbd> (see <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dQuitting">Glossary---Quitting</a>).
See <a href="Checklist.html">バグレポートのためのチェックリスト</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Backup File</span></dt>
<dd><p>A backup file records the contents that a file had before the current
editing session.  Emacs makes backup files automatically to help you
track down or cancel changes you later regret making.  See <a href="Backup.html">バックアップファイル</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Balancing Parentheses</span></dt>
<dd><p>Emacs can balance parentheses (or other matching delimiters) either
manually or automatically.  You do manual balancing with the commands
to move over parenthetical groupings (see <a href="Moving-by-Parens.html">カッコ構造の移動</a>).
Automatic balancing works by blinking or highlighting the delimiter
that matches the one you just inserted, or inserting the matching
delimiter for you (see <a href="Matching.html">Matching Parens</a>).
</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dBalanced-Expression"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Balanced Expressions</span></dt>
<dd><p>A balanced expression is a syntactically recognizable expression, such
as a symbol (q.v.), number, string constant, block, or parenthesized
expression in C.  See <a href="Expressions.html">Balanced Expressions</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Balloon Help</span></dt>
<dd><p>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dTooltips">Glossary---Tooltips</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Base Buffer</span></dt>
<dd><p>A base buffer is a buffer whose text is shared by an indirect buffer
(q.v.).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Bidirectional Text</span></dt>
<dd><p>Some human languages, such as English, are written from left to right.
Others, such as Arabic, are written from right to left.  Emacs
supports both of these forms, as well as any mixture of them&mdash;this
is &ldquo;bidirectional text&rdquo;.  See <a href="Bidirectional-Editing.html">双方向の編集</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Bind</span></dt>
<dd><span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dBind"></span><p>To bind a key sequence means to give it a binding (q.v.).
See <a href="Rebinding.html">対話的なキーバインディングの変更</a>.
</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dBinding"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Binding</span></dt>
<dd><p>A key sequence gets its meaning in Emacs by having a binding, which is a
command (q.v.)&mdash;a Lisp function that is run when you type that
sequence.  See <a href="Commands.html">Binding</a>.  Customization often involves
rebinding a character to a different command function.  The bindings of
all key sequences are recorded in the keymaps (q.v.).  See <a href="Keymaps.html">キーマップ</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Blank Lines</span></dt>
<dd><p>Blank lines are lines that contain only whitespace.  Emacs has several
commands for operating on the blank lines in the buffer.  See <a href="Blank-Lines.html">空行</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Bookmark</span></dt>
<dd><p>Bookmarks are akin to registers (q.v.) in that they record positions
in buffers to which you can return later.  Unlike registers, bookmarks
persist between Emacs sessions.  See <a href="Bookmarks.html">ブックマーク</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Border</span></dt>
<dd><p>A border is a thin space along the edge of the frame, used just for
spacing, not for displaying anything.  An Emacs frame has an ordinary
external border, outside of everything including the menu bar, plus an
internal border that surrounds the text windows, their scroll bars
and fringes, and separates them from the menu bar and tool bar.  You
can customize both borders with options and resources (see <a href="Borders-X.html">内枠ボーダーと外枠ボーダー</a>).  Borders are not the same as fringes (q.v.).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Buffer</span></dt>
<dd><p>The buffer is the basic editing unit; one buffer corresponds to one text
being edited.  You normally have several buffers, but at any time you are
editing only one, the current buffer, though several can be visible
when you are using multiple windows or frames (q.v.).  Most buffers
are visiting (q.v.) some file.  See <a href="Buffers.html">複数バッファーの使用</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Buffer Selection History</span></dt>
<dd><p>Emacs keeps a buffer selection history that records how recently each
Emacs buffer has been selected.  This is used for choosing which
buffer to select.  See <a href="Buffers.html">複数バッファーの使用</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Bug</span></dt>
<dd><p>A bug is an incorrect or unreasonable behavior of a program, or
inaccurate or confusing documentation.  Emacs developers treat bug
reports, both in Emacs code and its documentation, very seriously and
ask you to report any bugs you find.  See <a href="Bugs.html">バグの報告</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Button Down Event</span></dt>
<dd><p>A button down event is the kind of input event (q.v.) generated
right away when you press down on a mouse button.  See <a href="Mouse-Buttons.html">マウスボタンのリバインド</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>By Default</span></dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>cf.</span></dt>
<dt><span>c.f.</span></dt>
<dd><p>Short for &ldquo;confer&rdquo; in Latin, which means &ldquo;compare with&rdquo; or
&ldquo;compare to&rdquo;.  The second variant, &ldquo;c.f.&rdquo;, is a widespread
misspelling.
</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dC_002d"></span></dd>
<dt><span><kbd>C-</kbd></span></dt>
<dd><p><kbd>C-</kbd> in the name of a character is an abbreviation for Control.
See <a href="User-Input.html">C-</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><kbd>C-M-</kbd></span></dt>
<dd><p><kbd>C-M-</kbd> in the name of a character is an abbreviation for
Control-Meta.  If your terminal lacks a real <tt class="key">Meta</tt> key, you type
a Control-Meta character by typing <tt class="key">ESC</tt> and then typing the
corresponding Control character.  See <a href="User-Input.html">C-M-</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Case Conversion</span></dt>
<dd><p>Case conversion means changing text from upper case to lower case or
vice versa.  See <a href="Case.html">大文字小文字変換コマンド</a>.
</p>
<span id="index-ignore-case"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span>Case Folding</span></dt>
<dd><p>Case folding means ignoring the differences between case variants of
the same letter: upper-case, lower-case, and title-case.  Emacs
performs case folding by default in text search.  See <a href="Lax-Search.html">検索中のLaxマッチング</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Character</span></dt>
<dd><p>Characters form the contents of an Emacs buffer.  Also, key sequences
(q.v.) are usually made up of characters (though they may include
other input events as well).  See <a href="User-Input.html">ユーザー入力の種類</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Character Folding</span></dt>
<dd><p>Character folding means ignoring differences between similarly looking
characters, such as between <code>a</code>, and <code>&auml;</code> and <code>&aacute;</code>.
Emacs performs character folding by default in text search.  See <a href="Lax-Search.html">検索中のLaxマッチング</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Character Set</span></dt>
<dd><p>Emacs supports a number of character sets, each of which represents a
particular alphabet or script.  See <a href="International.html">国際化文字セットのサポート</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Character Terminal</span></dt>
<dd><p>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dText-Terminal">Glossary---Text Terminal</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Click Event</span></dt>
<dd><p>A click event is the kind of input event (q.v.) generated when you
press a mouse button and release it without moving the mouse.
See <a href="Mouse-Buttons.html">マウスボタンのリバインド</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Client</span></dt>
<dd><p>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dServer">Glossary---Server</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Clipboard</span></dt>
<dd><p>A clipboard is a buffer provided by the window system for transferring
text between applications.  On the X Window System, the clipboard is
provided in addition to the primary selection (q.v.); on MS-Windows and Mac,
the clipboard is used <em>instead</em> of the primary selection.
See <a href="Clipboard.html">クリップボードを使う</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Coding System</span></dt>
<dd><p>A coding system is a way to encode text characters in a file or in a
stream of information.  Emacs has the ability to convert text to or
from a variety of coding systems when reading or writing it.
See <a href="Coding-Systems.html">コーディングシステム</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Command</span></dt>
<dd><p>A command is a Lisp function specially defined to be able to serve as
a key binding in Emacs or to be invoked by its name
(see <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dCommand-Name">Glossary---Command Name</a>).  (Another term for <em>command</em> is
<em>interactive function</em>&mdash;they are used interchangeably.)  When you
type a key sequence (q.v.), its binding (q.v.) is looked up in the
relevant keymaps (q.v.) to find the command to run.
See <a href="Commands.html">キーとコマンド</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Command History</span></dt>
<dd><p>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dMinibuffer-History">Glossary---Minibuffer History</a>.
</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dCommand-Name"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Command Name</span></dt>
<dd><p>A command name is the name of a Lisp symbol (q.v.) that is a command
(see <a href="Commands.html">キーとコマンド</a>).  You can invoke any command by its name using
<kbd>M-x</kbd> (see <a href="M_002dx.html">Running Commands by Name</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Comment</span></dt>
<dd><p>A comment is text in a program which is intended only for humans reading
the program, and which is specially marked so that it will be ignored
when the program is loaded or compiled.  Emacs offers special commands
for creating, aligning and killing comments.  See <a href="Comments.html">コメントの操作</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Common Lisp</span></dt>
<dd><p>Common Lisp is a dialect of Lisp (q.v.) much larger and more powerful
than Emacs Lisp.  Emacs provides a subset of Common Lisp in the CL
package.  See <a data-manual="cl" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/index.html#Top">Overview</a> in <cite>Common Lisp Extensions</cite>.
</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dCompilation"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Compilation</span></dt>
<dd><p>Compilation is the process of creating an executable program from source
code.  Emacs has commands for compiling files of Emacs Lisp code
(see <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Byte-Compilation.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a> in <cite>the Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</cite>) and programs in C and other languages
(see <a href="Compilation.html">Emacs下でのコンパイルの実行</a>).  Byte-compiled Emacs Lisp code loads and
executes faster.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Complete Key</span></dt>
<dd><p>A complete key is a key sequence that fully specifies one action to be
performed by Emacs.  For example, <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x
m</kbd> are complete keys.  Complete keys derive their meanings from being
bound (see <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dBind">Glossary---Bind</a>) to commands (q.v.).  Thus, <kbd>X</kbd> is
conventionally bound to a command to insert &lsquo;<samp>X</samp>&rsquo; in the buffer;
<kbd>C-x m</kbd> is conventionally bound to a command to begin composing a
mail message.  See <a href="Keys.html">キー</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Completion</span></dt>
<dd><p>Completion is what Emacs does when it automatically expands an
abbreviation for a name into the entire name.  Completion is done for
minibuffer (q.v.) arguments when the set of possible valid inputs
is known; for example, on command names, buffer names, and
file names.  Completion usually occurs when <tt class="key">TAB</tt>, <tt class="key">SPC</tt> or
<tt class="key">RET</tt> is typed.  See <a href="Completion.html">補完</a>.
</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dContinuation-Line"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Continuation Line</span></dt>
<dd><p>When a line of text is longer than the width of the window, it
normally takes up more than one screen line when displayed (but see
<a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dTruncation">Glossary---Truncation</a>).  We say that the text line is continued,
and all screen lines used for it after the first are called
continuation lines.  See <a href="Continuation-Lines.html">継続行</a>.  A related Emacs
feature is filling (q.v.).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Control Character</span></dt>
<dd><p>A control character is a character that you type by holding down the
<tt class="key">Ctrl</tt> key.  Some control characters also have their own keys, so
that you can type them without using <tt class="key">Ctrl</tt>.  For example,
<tt class="key">RET</tt>, <tt class="key">TAB</tt>, <tt class="key">ESC</tt> and <tt class="key">DEL</tt> are all control
characters.  See <a href="User-Input.html">ユーザー入力の種類</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Copyleft</span></dt>
<dd><p>A copyleft is a notice giving the public legal permission to
redistribute and modify a program or other work of art, but requiring
modified versions to carry similar permission.  Copyright is normally
used to keep users divided and helpless; with copyleft we turn that
around to empower users and encourage them to cooperate.
</p>
<p>The particular form of copyleft used by the GNU project is called the
GNU General Public License.  See <a href="Copying.html">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><tt class="key">Ctrl</tt></span></dt>
<dd><p>The <tt class="key">Ctrl</tt> or control key is what you hold down
in order to enter a control character (q.v.).  See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dC_002d">Glossary---C-</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Current Buffer</span></dt>
<dd><p>The current buffer in Emacs is the Emacs buffer on which most editing
commands operate.  You can select any Emacs buffer as the current one.
See <a href="Buffers.html">複数バッファーの使用</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Current Line</span></dt>
<dd><p>The current line is the line that point is on (see <a href="Point.html">ポイント</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Current Paragraph</span></dt>
<dd><p>The current paragraph is the paragraph that point is in.  If point is
between two paragraphs, the current paragraph is the one that follows
point.  See <a href="Paragraphs.html">パラグラフ</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Current Defun</span></dt>
<dd><p>The current defun is the defun (q.v.) that point is in.  If point is
between defuns, the current defun is the one that follows point.
See <a href="Defuns.html">トップレベルの定義、またはdefun</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Cursor</span></dt>
<dd><p>The cursor is the rectangle on the screen which indicates the position
(called point; q.v.) at which insertion and deletion takes place.
The cursor is on or under the character that follows point.  Often
people speak of &ldquo;the cursor&rdquo; when, strictly speaking, they mean
&ldquo;point&rdquo;.  See <a href="Point.html">Cursor</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Customization</span></dt>
<dd><p>Customization is making minor changes in the way Emacs works, to
reflect your preferences or needs.  It is often done by setting
variables (see <a href="Variables.html">変数</a>) or faces (see <a href="Face-Customization.html">フェイスのカスタマイズ</a>),
or by rebinding key sequences (see <a href="Keymaps.html">キーマップ</a>).

</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dDaemon"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Daemon</span></dt>
<dd><p>A daemon is a standard term for a system-level process that runs in the
background.  Daemons are often started when the system first starts up.
When Emacs runs in daemon-mode, it does not
open a display.  You connect to it with the
<code>emacsclient</code> program.  See <a href="Emacs-Server.html">サーバーとしてのEmacsの使用</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Default Argument</span></dt>
<dd><p>The default for an argument is the value that will be assumed if you
do not specify one.  When the minibuffer is used to read an argument,
the default argument is used if you just type <tt class="key">RET</tt>.
See <a href="Minibuffer.html">ミニバッファー</a>.
</p>
<span id="Glossary_002d_002d_002dDefault"></span></dd>
<dt><span>Default</span></dt>
<dd><p>A default is the value that is used for a certain purpose when
you do not explicitly specify a value to use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Default Directory</span></dt>
<dd><p>When you specify a file name that does not start with &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo;,
it is interpreted relative to the current buffer&rsquo;s default directory.
(On MS systems, file names that start with a drive letter
&lsquo;<samp><var>x</var>:</samp>&rsquo; are treated as absolute, not relative.)
See <a href="Minibuffer-File.html">Default Directory</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Defun</span></dt>
<dd><p>A defun is a major definition at the top level in a program.  The name
&ldquo;defun&rdquo; comes from Lisp, where most such definitions use the construct
<code>defun</code>.  See <a href="Defuns.html">トップレベルの定義、またはdefun</a>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><span>File Name</span></dt>
<dd><p>A file name is a name that refers to a file.  File names may be relative
or absolute; the meaning of a relative file name depends on the current
directory, but an absolute file name refers to the same file regardless
of which directory is current.  On GNU and Unix systems, an absolute
file name starts with a slash (the root directory) or with &lsquo;<samp>~/</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>~<var>user</var>/</samp>&rsquo; (a home directory).  On MS-Windows/MS-DOS, an
absolute file name can also start with a drive letter and a colon, e.g.,
&lsquo;<samp><var>d</var>:</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Some people use the term &ldquo;pathname&rdquo; for file names, but we do not;
we use the word &ldquo;path&rdquo; only in the term &ldquo;search path&rdquo; (q.v.).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>File-Name Component</span></dt>
<dd><p>A file-name component names a file directly within a particular
directory.  On GNU and Unix systems, a file name is a sequence of
file-name components, separated by slashes.  For example, <samp>foo/bar</samp>
is a file name containing two components, &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>bar</samp>&rsquo;; it
refers to the file named &lsquo;<samp>bar</samp>&rsquo; in the directory named &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo; in
the current directory.  MS-DOS/MS-Windows file names can also use
backslashes to separate components, as in <samp>foo\bar</samp>.

<dt><span>Quoting</span></dt>
<dd><p>Quoting means depriving a character of its usual special significance.
The most common kind of quoting in Emacs is with <kbd>C-q</kbd>.  What
constitutes special significance depends on the context and on
convention.  For example, an ordinary character as an Emacs command
inserts itself; so in this context, a special character is any character
that does not normally insert itself (such as <tt class="key">DEL</tt>, for example),
and quoting it makes it insert itself as if it were not special.  Not
all contexts allow quoting.  See <a href="Inserting-Text.html">Quoting</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Quoting File Names</span></dt>
<dd><p>Quoting a file name turns off the special significance of constructs

<dd><p>The speedbar is a special tall frame that provides fast access to Emacs
buffers, functions within those buffers, Info nodes, and other
interesting parts of text within Emacs.  See <a href="Speedbar.html">スピードバーフレーム</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Spell Checking</span></dt>
<dd><p>Spell checking means checking correctness of the written form of each
one of the words in a text.  Emacs can use various external
spelling-checker programs to check the spelling of parts of a buffer
via a convenient user interface.  See <a href="Spelling.html">スペルのチェックと訂正</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>String</span></dt>
<dd><p>A string is a kind of Lisp data object that contains a sequence of
characters.  Many Emacs variables are intended to have strings as
values.  The Lisp syntax for a string consists of the characters in the
string with a &lsquo;<samp>&quot;</samp>&rsquo; before and another &lsquo;<samp>&quot;</samp>&rsquo; after.  A &lsquo;<samp>&quot;</samp>&rsquo;
that is part of the string must be written as &lsquo;<samp>\&quot;</samp>&rsquo; and a &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo;
that is part of the string must be written as &lsquo;<samp>\\</samp>&rsquo;.  All other
characters, including newline, can be included just by writing them
inside the string; however, backslash sequences as in C, such as
&lsquo;<samp>\n</samp>&rsquo; for newline or &lsquo;<samp>\241</samp>&rsquo; using an octal character code, are
allowed as well.

<dt><span>Symbol</span></dt>
<dd><p>A symbol in Emacs Lisp is an object with a name.  The object can be a
variable (q.v.), a function or command (q.v.), or a face (q.v.).
The symbol&rsquo;s name serves as the printed representation of the symbol.

<kbd>Super-</kbd> (usually written <kbd>s-</kbd> for short).  See <a href="Modifier-Keys.html">修飾キー</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Suspending</span></dt>
<dd><p>Suspending Emacs means stopping it temporarily and returning control
to its parent process, which is usually a shell.  Unlike killing a job
(q.v.), you can later resume the suspended Emacs job without losing
your buffers, unsaved edits, undo history, etc.  See <a href="Exiting.html">Emacsからのexit</a>.
</p>

<dt><span>Text</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>&ldquo;Text&rdquo; has two meanings (see <a href="Text.html">人間の言語のためのコマンド</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li> Data consisting of a sequence of characters, as opposed to binary
numbers, executable programs, and the like.  The basic contents of an
Emacs buffer (aside from the text properties, q.v.) are always text
in this sense.

</li><li> Data consisting of written human language (as opposed to programs),
or following the stylistic conventions of human language.
</li></ul>

individual pixels it displays.  Emacs supports a subset of display
features on text terminals.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Text Properties</span></dt>
<dd><p>Text properties are annotations recorded for particular characters in

</dd>
<dt><span>Tool Bar</span></dt>
<dd><p>The tool bar is a line (sometimes multiple lines) of icons at the top
of an Emacs frame.  Clicking on one of these icons executes a command.

explains parts of the display, lists useful options available via mouse
clicks, etc.  See <a href="Tooltips.html">ツールチップ</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Top Level</span></dt>
<dd><p>Top level is the normal state of Emacs, in which you are editing the
text of the file you have visited.  You are at top level whenever you
are not in a recursive editing level (q.v.) or the minibuffer
(q.v.), and not in the middle of a command.  You can get back to top
level by aborting (q.v.) and quitting (q.v.).  See <a href="Quitting.html">中止と中断</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Transient Mark Mode</span></dt>

setting the mark activates it and highlights the region, is called
Transient Mark mode.  It is enabled by default.  See <a href="Disabled-Transient-Mark.html">Transient Markモードを無効にする</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Transposition</span></dt>
<dd><p>Transposing two units of text means putting each one into the place
formerly occupied by the other.  There are Emacs commands to transpose
two adjacent characters, words, balanced expressions (q.v.) or lines
(see <a href="Transpose.html">テキストの入れ替え</a>).

</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>User Option</span></dt>
<dd><p>A user option is a face (q.v.) or a variable (q.v.) that exists so
that you can customize Emacs by setting it to a new value.
See <a href="Easy-Customization.html">Easy Customizationインターフェース</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Variable</span></dt>
<dd><p>A variable is an object in Lisp that can store an arbitrary value.
Emacs uses some variables for internal purposes, and has others (known
as &ldquo;user options&rdquo;; q.v.) just so that you can set their values to
control the behavior of Emacs.  The variables used in Emacs that you
are likely to be interested in are listed in the Variables Index in
this manual (see <a href="Variable-Index.html">Variable Index</a>).  See <a href="Variables.html">変数</a>, for
information on variables.

<dt><span>Window</span></dt>
<dd><p>Emacs divides a frame (q.v.) into one or more windows, each of which
can display the contents of one buffer (q.v.) at any time.
See <a href="Screen.html">画面の構成</a>, for basic information on how Emacs uses the screen.
See <a href="Windows.html">複数ウィンドウ</a>, for commands to control the use of windows.  Some
other editors use the term &ldquo;window&rdquo; for what we call a &ldquo;frame&rdquo; in
Emacs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Window System</span></dt>
<dd><p>A window system is software that operates on a graphical display
(q.v.), to subdivide the screen so that multiple applications can have
their own windows at the same time.  All modern operating systems
include a window system.
