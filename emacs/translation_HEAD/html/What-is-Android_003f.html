<p>Android is an operating system for mobile devices developed by the Open
Handset Alliance, a group of companies interested in developing handsets
that can run a common set of software.  It is supposedly free software.
</p>
<p>Like the X Consortium of times past, the Open Handset Alliance believes that
&ldquo;openness&rdquo; (namely, the regular release of the Android source code) is
simply a tool to increase the popularity of the Android platform.  Computer
companies normally produce proprietary software.  The companies in the Open
Handset Alliance are no different &ndash; most versions of Android installed on
devices are proprietary, by virtue of containing proprietary components,
that often cannot even be replaced by the user.
</p>
<p>Android is not designed to respect users&rsquo; freedom.  Almost all versions of
Android (including some which are supposedly free software) include support
for Digital Restrictions Management, technology that is designed to limit
users&rsquo; ability to copy media to and from their own devices.  Most Android
devices also come with proprietary Google applications which are required to
run the system, and many other Android applications.
</p>
<p>Thus, it must be necessary to consider Android proprietary software from a
practical standpoint.  That is an injustice.  If you use Android, we urge
you to switch to a free operating system, if only for your freedom&rsquo;s sake.
</p>
<p>We support GNU Emacs on proprietary operating systems because we hope this
taste of freedom will inspire users to escape from them.
