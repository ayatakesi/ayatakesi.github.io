<span id="Using-Emacs-with-Virtual-Keyboards"></span><h3 class="section">6.2 Using Emacs with Virtual Keyboards</h3>
<span id="index-virtual-keyboards"></span>
<span id="index-on_002dscreen-keyboards"></span>

<p>When there is no physical keyboard attached to a system, its windowing
system might provide an on-screen keyboard, widely known as a &ldquo;virtual
keyboard&rdquo;, containing rows of clickable buttons that send keyboard input to
the application, much as a real keyboard would.
</p>
<p>This virtual keyboard is hidden when the focused program is not requesting
text input as it occupies scarce space on display, and programs are
therefore enjoined to display it once they are ready to accept keyboard
input.  Systems running X detect when the presence of the virtual keyboard
is warranted, but on others such as Android Emacs is responsible for
displaying it when need be, generally in reaction to a touch screen &ldquo;tap&rdquo;
gesture (see <a href="Touchscreens.html">Using Emacs on Touchscreens</a>) or the minibuffer being brought into use
(see <a href="Minibuffer.html">ミニバッファー</a>).
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dset_002dpoint_002dcommands"></span>
<p>When a &ldquo;tap&rdquo; gesture results in a command being executed, Emacs checks
whether the command is meant to set the point by searching for it in the
list <code>touch-screen-set-point-commands</code>.  If it is, and the text beneath
the new point is not read-only, the virtual keyboard is activated, in
anticipation of the user input there.
</p>
<p>The default value of <code>touch-screen-set-point-commands</code> holds only the
command <code>mouse-set-point</code> (see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html">編集のためのマウスコマンド</a>), which is the
default binding of <code>mouse-1</code>, and therefore of touchscreen tap gestures
as well.
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002ddisplay_002dkeyboard"></span>
<p>The user option <code>touch-screen-display-keyboard</code> compels Emacs to
display the virtual keyboard on all tap gestures even if the text is read
only; it may also be set buffer locally, in which case Emacs will always
display the keyboard in response to a tap on a window displaying the buffer
it is set in.
</p>
<p>There are moreover several functions that display or hide the on-screen
keyboard.  For more details, See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/On_002dScreen-Keyboards.html#On_002dScreen-Keyboards">On-Screen Keyboards</a> in <cite>The Emacs
Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<span id="index-quitting_002c-without-a-keyboard"></span>
<p>Since it may not be possible for Emacs to display the virtual keyboard while
it is executing a command, Emacs implements a feature on window systems
frequently equipped with no physical keyboard, by which two rapid clicks of
a hardware button that is always present on the device induces a quit.
See <a href="Quitting.html">中止と中断</a>.
</p>
<span id="index-x_002dquit_002dkeysym"></span>
<span id="index-android_002dquit_002dkeycode"></span>
<p>No such button is enabled on X, but one can be configured through the
variable <code>x-quit-keysym</code>, whereas the default key is the volume down
button on Android, which is also configurable through a variable,
<code>android-quit-keycode</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-text-conversion_002c-keyboards"></span>
<p>Most input methods designed to work with virtual keyboards edit text
differently from desktop input methods.
</p>
<p>On a conventional desktop windowing system, an input method will simply
display the contents of any ongoing character composition on screen, and
send key events reflecting its contents to Emacs after it is confirmed by
the user.
</p>
<p>By contrast, virtual keyboard input methods directly perform edits to the
selected window of each frame; this is known as &ldquo;text conversion&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;string conversion&rdquo; under the X Window System.
</p>
<p>Emacs enables these input methods whenever the buffer local value of
<code>text-conversion-style</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, that is to say, generally
inside derivatives of <code>text-mode</code> and <code>prog-mode</code>.
</p>
<p>Text conversion is performed asynchronously whenever Emacs receives a
request to perform the conversion from the input method, and Emacs is not
currently reading a key sequence for which one prefix key has already been
read (see <a href="Keys.html">キー</a>).  After the conversion completes, a
<code>text-conversion</code> event is sent.  See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Misc-Events.html#Misc-Events">Misc Events</a> in <cite>the Emacs
Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<span id="index-text_002dconversion_002dface"></span>
<p>If the input method needs to work on a region of the buffer, then the region
is designated the &ldquo;composing region&rdquo; (or &ldquo;preconversion region&rdquo;).  The
variable <code>text-conversion-face</code> controls whether to display the
composing region in a distinctive face, and if so, which face to employ.
