<span id="Using-Emacs-with-Virtual-Keyboards"></span><h3 class="section">J.2 Using Emacs with Virtual Keyboards</h3>
<span id="index-virtual-keyboards"></span>
<span id="index-on_002dscreen-keyboards"></span>

<p>When there is no physical keyboard attached to a system, the windowing
system typically provides an on-screen keyboard, more often known as a
&ldquo;virtual keyboard&rdquo;, containing rows of clickable buttons that send
keyboard input to the application, much like a real keyboard would.  This
virtual keyboard is hidden by default, as it uses up valuable on-screen real
estate, and must be opened once the program being used is ready to accept
keyboard input.
</p>
<p>Under the X Window System, the client that provides the on-screen keyboard
typically detects when the application is ready to accept keyboard input
through a set of complex heuristics, and automatically displays the keyboard
when necessary.
</p>
<p>On other systems such as Android, Emacs must tell the system when it is
ready to accept keyboard input.  Typically, this is done in response to a
touchscreen &ldquo;tap&rdquo; gesture (see <a href="Touchscreens.html">Using Emacs on Touchscreens</a>), or once to the
minibuffer becomes in use (see <a href="Minibuffer.html">ミニバッファー</a>.)
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dset_002dpoint_002dcommands"></span>
<p>When a &ldquo;tap&rdquo; gesture results in a command being executed, Emacs checks to
see whether or not the command is supposed to set the point by looking for
it in the list <code>touch-screen-set-point-commands</code>.  If it is, then Emacs
looks up whether or not the text under the point is read-only; if not, it
activates the on-screen keyboard, assuming that the user is about to enter
text in to the current buffer.
</p>
<span id="index-touch_002dscreen_002ddisplay_002dkeyboard"></span>
<p>The user option <code>touch-screen-display-keyboard</code> forces Emacs to always
display the on screen keyboard; it may also be set buffer locally, which
means that Emacs should always display the keyboard when the buffer is
selected.
</p>
<p>Emacs also provides a set of functions to show or hide the on-screen
keyboard.  For more details, see <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/On_002dScreen-Keyboards.html#On_002dScreen-Keyboards">On-Screen Keyboards</a> in <cite>The Emacs
Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<span id="index-quitting_002c-without-a-keyboard"></span>
<p>Since it may not be possible for Emacs to display the on screen keyboard
while it is executing a command, Emacs implements a feature on devices with
only an on-screen keyboard, by which two rapid clicks of a hardware button
that is always present on the device results in Emacs quitting.
See <a href="Quitting.html">中止と中断</a>.
</p>
<span id="index-x_002dquit_002dkeysym"></span>
<p>Which button is used to do this depends on the window system in use: on X,
it is defined in the variable <code>x-quit-keysym</code>, and on Android, it is
always the volume down button.
</p>
<span id="index-text-conversion_002c-keyboards"></span>
<p>Most input methods designed to work with on-screen keyboards perform buffer
edits differently from desktop input methods.
</p>
<p>On a conventional desktop windowing system, an input method will simply
display the contents of any on going character compositions on screen, and
send the appropriate key events to Emacs after completion.
</p>
<p>However, on screen keyboard input methods directly perform edits to the
selected window of each frame; this is known as &ldquo;text conversion&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;string conversion&rdquo; under the X Window System.  Emacs enables these input
methods whenever the buffer local value of <code>text-conversion-style</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, normally inside derivatives of <code>text-mode</code> and
<code>prog-mode</code>.
</p>
<p>Text conversion is performed asynchronously whenever Emacs receives a
request to perform the conversion from the input method, and Emacs is not
currently reading a key sequence for which one prefix key has already been
read (see <a href="Keys.html">キー</a>.)  After the conversion completes, a
<code>text-conversion</code> event is sent.  See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Misc-Events.html#Misc-Events">Misc Events</a> in <cite>the Emacs
Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<span id="index-text_002dconversion_002dface"></span>
<p>If the input method needs to work on a region of the buffer, then the region
becomes known as the &ldquo;composing region&rdquo; (or &ldquo;preconversion region&rdquo;.)
The variable <code>text-conversion-face</code> describes whether or not to display
the composing region in a specific face.
