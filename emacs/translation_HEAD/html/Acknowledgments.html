<p>Many people have contributed code included in the Free Software Foundation&rsquo;s
distribution of GNU Emacs.  To show our appreciation for their public
spirit, we list here in alphabetical order those who have written
substantial portions.  Others too numerous to mention have reported and
fixed bugs, and added features to many parts of Emacs.  We thank them for
their generosity as well.
</p>
<p>This list is intended to mention every contributor of a major package or
feature; if you know of someone we have omitted, please make a bug report.
More comprehensive information is available in the <samp class="file">ChangeLog</samp> files,
summarized in the file <samp class="file">etc/AUTHORS</samp> in the distribution.
