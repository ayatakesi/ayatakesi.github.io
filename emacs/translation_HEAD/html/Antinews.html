<span id="Emacs-29-Antinews"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Emacs 29 Antinews</h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 29.4.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;30.0.60<!-- /@w -->
features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Emacs can no longer be built for Android mobile devices.  We have removed
the Android support because it was deemed unnecessary, what with the screens
of the mobile devices becoming smaller and smaller as you move back in
time.  We expect Android users to enjoy the much simpler text editors
available on their devices.  As a nice bonus, removing Android support
allowed us to get rid of gobs of related files, thus making the release
tarballs much leaner.

</li><li> We have deleted much of the enhanced support for touchscreen devices, for
the same reason we dropped Android: there will be no need for that as you
move back in time.

</li><li> We also dropped support for sophisticated input methods that include text
conversions, again because those are mostly needed on mobile and hand-held
devices, which we gradually remove from Emacs in each past version.

</li><li> Like its newer releases, Emacs 29 can still be built with support of native
compilation of Lisp programs.  However, in preparation for removal of this
feature in some previous version, we&rsquo;ve made the native compiler support off
by default; you will now have to request it explicitly at configure time.
This makes the default Emacs build process much faster.

</li><li> JSON interfaces are slowly move into oblivion as past years come closer, so
we have removed our internal implementation of JSON; you will now need to
build Emacs with the libjansson library, if you need JSON.  Eventually, we
plan on removing JSON support from Emacs altogether; this move will make the
removal much simpler.

</li><li> Tree-sitter based modes are now completely independent of their
non-Tree-Sitter counterparts.  We decided that keeping the settings separate
and independent goes a long way toward simplicity, which is one of our main
motivation for removing stuff from Emacs.

</li><li> Various Help commands no longer turn on Outline minor mode.  With less
material to display in the *Help* buffers, due to removing of excess
documentation from Emacs, we think using outlining is an unnecessary
complication, as scrolling through plain text is so much simpler.

<p>For the same reasons, Emacs no longer shows Unicode names of characters in
*Help* buffers shown by <code>describe-bindings</code>.
</p>
</li><li> To make Emacs configuration simpler and easier to control, the tool bar can
now be displayed only in its natural and logical position: on the top of the
frame; no more of that <code>tool-bar-position</code> nonsense with tool bars on
the bottom.  For the same reasons <code>modifier-bar-mode</code> is now gone.

</li><li> The command <code>recover-file</code> no longer allows to display the diffs
between a file and its auto-save file.  You either want to recover a file or
you don&rsquo;t; confusing users with a third alternative when they are anxious
already by the possibility of losing precious edits is considered a bad
idea, certainly so as we move further towards smaller, simpler Emacs.

</li><li> Several languages and input methods, which will fall in disuse as you move
back in time, were removed.  This includes Urdu, Pashto, and Sindhi
languages, and the input method for the Colemak keyboard layout.  Many
<kbd>C-x 8</kbd> key sequences, including those which insert various quotation
characters and guillemets, were deleted for the same reason.

</li><li> The support for <code>lzip</code>-compressed Info manuals was removed from the
Info mode.  We anticipate that <code>lzip</code> will disappear from the face
of the Earth in the near past, and are preparing Emacs for that in advance.

</li><li> Support for LLDB in Grand Unified Debugger mode was dropped.  We decided
that given LLDB&rsquo;s diminishing popularity, its support is just code bloat.

</li><li> Several fancy Project and VC commands were deleted, as part of our
consistent effort of making Emacs simpler to use.

</li><li> The user option <code>shell-command-guess-functions</code> and the context menu
&lsquo;<samp>Open With</samp>&rsquo; in Dired are gone.  We trust Emacs users to always know
themselves which shell command is the appropriate one for a given file, so
no guessing by Dired is needed, or welcome.  The <code>dired-do-open</code>
command was deleted for the same reasons.

</li><li> We went back to the original lean-and-mean interface for specifying
registers for register-related commands.  The fancy preview and the options
to go with it were deemed gratuitous and were removed.

</li><li> Eshell is now much smaller and easier to use, due to dropping quite a few of
the new commands and fancy new options.

</li><li> The command <code>customize-dirlocals</code> was removed.  Editing the
<samp>.dir-locals.el</samp> files as plain text is so much simpler, and quite
enough.

</li><li> We have removed several packages that we consider unnecessary for the past
of Emacs.  This includes EditorConfig support, &lsquo;<samp>which-key</samp>&rsquo;, PEG, and
Window-Tool-Bar.

</li><li> The <code>etags-regen-mode</code> was deleted.  Regeneration of <samp>TAGS</samp> tables
manually is all Emacs users will need in the past.

</li><li> To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space, many
other functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 29.4.
</li></ul>
