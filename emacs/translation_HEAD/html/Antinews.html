<span id="Emacs-28-Antinews"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Emacs 28 Antinews</h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 28.2.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;27.2.50<!-- /@w -->
features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Like its newer releases, Emacs 28 can still be built with support of native
compilation of Lisp programs.  However, in preparation for removal of this
feature in some previous version, we&rsquo;ve deleted the capability of
ahead-of-time native compilation of all the Lisp files that come with
Emacs.  This makes the Emacs build process much faster.

</li><li> Emacs can no longer be built with the tree-sitter library, so you no longer
will need to look for and install the grammar libraries for the languages in
which you want to program.  Similarly, all the modes that are based on the
tree-sitter library were deleted, leaving you with just one major mode for
every supported programming language: no more need to decide whether to turn
the tree-sitter supported modes on and try using their parser-based
fontification, indentation, and other features.  For some languages and file
types, this means no major mode at all, leaving you with the venerable
Fundamental mode as the natural, high-performance choice.  For example, Go,
Rust, and CMake files no longer have any major modes for editing their files
&mdash; another milestone towards a simpler, leaner Emacs.

</li><li> Built-in support for accessing SQLite databases was removed.  You can now
again edit SQLite files as simple binary files, which Emacs is quite capable
to support, as it always did.

</li><li> As a gesture to users of the Haiku operating system, we&rsquo;ve dropped the code
which allowed Emacs to be built on that OS.  We expect Haiku users to enjoy
the much simpler editors they have for editing their files.

</li><li> Support for XInput2 input events on X is gone.  We think the traditional X
input events are more than enough, certainly so as you move back in time,
where XInput2 will eventually be removed from X as well, once the
maintainers of the X Windows system realize the utter futility of supporting
fancy input mechanisms.

</li><li> The &ldquo;pure GTK&rdquo; (a.k.a. <acronym>PGTK</acronym>) configuration of Emacs is no
longer supported.  This is in anticipation of the complete removal of the
GTK toolkit support from Emacs, and in accordance with our expectation that
GTK will cease to exist as you move back in time.  We plan on removing
support for all the other toolkits as well, leaving only the pure X build
with our own widgets as the single supported GUI configuration on X.

</li><li> The <samp>--init-directory</samp> command-line option was removed, as
initializing Emacs with init files of another user is a preposterous idea
anyway.

</li><li> In line with simplifying and eventually removing the native-compilation
option, we&rsquo;ve deleted the <samp>--with-native-compilation=aot</samp>
configure-time option.  This greatly simplifies how native compilation works
and makes your configure-time decision regarding native compilation in Emacs
clear-cut: either Emacs compiles non-preloaded Lisp packages to native code
only before using it, or it never uses native compilation at all; no more
half measures and special exceptions.  For similar reasons,
<code>native-compile-prune-cache</code> and <code>startup-redirect-eln-cache</code>
features are no longer part of Emacs.

</li><li> We&rsquo;ve deleted the special code and features which allowed Emacs to present
decent performance and responsiveness when editing files with very long
lines.  Such files become more and more rare as time goes back, and so
having all this tricky code in Emacs for their benefit was deemed an
unnecessary complication.

</li><li> Emacs dropped support for Eglot and the LSP servers.  We decided that the
built-in ways of analyzing source code are more than enough as you move back
in time.

</li><li> Commands to scale and rotate images are once again bound to single keys like
<kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>, and <kbd>r</kbd>, which makes them much easier to type.  As for
the risk of typing these by mistake, we don&rsquo;t believe Emacs users make
typing mistakes, especially as they move back in time and become younger and
younger.

</li><li> To simplify typing popular commands, we&rsquo;ve rebound the <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;8&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w -->
back to <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;8&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w --> and <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;8&nbsp;=&nbsp;=</kbd><!-- /@w --> back to <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;8&nbsp;=</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  There&rsquo;s no need for fancier, longer key sequences, as moving back in
time means we will have fewer and fewer commands to bind to them in the
first place.

</li><li> If you inadvertently kill the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer, Emacs will recreate
it in Fundamental mode, not in Lisp Interaction mode.  You get to turn on
the mode you like yourself.  Our long-term plans for past Emacs releases is
to remove the recreation of <samp>*scratch*</samp> altogether, and this is the
first step in that direction.

</li><li> Support for <code>rlogin</code> and <code>rsh</code> protocols are back, since we expect
them to become more and more important and popular as you move back in time.

</li><li> In preparation for eventual removal of Unicode support from Emacs, we&rsquo;ve
downgraded our Unicode support to version 14.0.

</li><li> You can no longer change the size of the font globally.  Since Emacs will at
some past date remove all support for variable-size fonts, having such
commands is a luxury we are better without.

</li><li> On our permanent quest for simplifying Emacs, we&rsquo;ve removed the commands
<code>duplicate-line</code> and <code>duplicate-dwim</code>; the old-time friends
<kbd>M-w</kbd> and <kbd>C-y</kbd> (typed one or more times) should suffice.  The
command <code>rename-visited-file</code> is gone for the same reason.

</li><li> We&rsquo;ve deleted many commands related to Emoji, which were bound in the
<kbd>C-x 8 e</kbd> prefix keymap.  We decided that the ability to type Emoji
sequences using <kbd>C-x 8 <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> is enough, and actually serves our
users better by requiring them to know the codepoints of the sequences they
want to type.

</li><li> We dropped support for many scripts and input methods, especially old
scripts that no one uses anyway.  For similar reasons, Greek and Ukrainian
translations of the Emacs tutorial are not available anymore.

</li><li> <samp>package.el</samp> can no longer fetch source code of packages from their VCS
repositories.  We think command-line tools like Git should be enough to
allow you to clone their repositories.  So we deleted the
<code>package-vc-install</code> command and other similar commands.

</li><li> To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space, many
other functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 28.2.
</li></ul>
