<h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Emacs 27 Antinews</h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 27.2.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;27.2.50<!-- /@w -->
features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Emacs can no longer be built with support of native compilation of Lisp
programs.  This means Emacs builds much faster, and the problems that came
with native compilation: the need to have GCC and Binutils installed, the
complications of managing your <samp>eln-cache</samp> directories&mdash;all of that is
now future history.  The simplicity and elegance of the Emacs byte-compiled
code is now restored in all of its pristine beauty.

</li><li> Emacs no longer builds by default with Cairo, even if it&rsquo;s present.  The
warnings about not using HarfBuzz are also gone, in preparation for complete
removal of HarfBuzz support in previous Emacs versions.  Fancy text shaping
and display is becoming less important as you move back in time.  The
<code>ftx</code> font backend is again part of Emacs, for the same reasons.

</li><li> As Motif becomes more and more important with moving farther into the past,
we&rsquo;ve reinstated the code which supports Motif in Emacs.

</li><li> Emacs once again supports versions 5.3 and older OpenBSD systems, which will
be needed as you move back in time.

</li><li> We&rsquo;ve dropped support for Secure Computing filter on GNU/Linux.  The past
world is much more secure than the present, so the complexities related with
this stuff, which can only be explained by severe paranoia, are no longer
justified.

</li><li> Emacs reverted back to supporting Unicode 13.x, since the following versions
of the standards are not yet published where you are going.  The
&lsquo;<samp>emoji</samp>&rsquo; script and the support for displaying Emoji sequences were
removed for the same reasons: no one will produce them in the past.

</li><li> Mode-specific commands and the <kbd>M-S-x</kbd> command that invokes them were
removed.  As you move back in time, the command set in Emacs becomes
smaller, so any such filtering of applicable commands just gets in the way.

</li><li> We have removed the system for displaying documentation of groups of related
functions, the <kbd>shortdoc-display-group</kbd> command to go with it, and the
corresponding &ldquo;See also&rdquo; button in the <samp>*Help*</samp> buffer.  That should
make searching for certain functions simpler: just use the venerable
&lsquo;<samp>apropos</samp>&rsquo; commands.

</li><li> The <code>context-menu-mode</code> was removed, and with it the context menus
popped by pressing the right mouse button.  This is one small step towards
freeing Emacs (and eventually, the whole world of computing) from the
tyranny of the GUI pointing devices in general, and moving back to the
simplicity of text-mode user interfaces.  Down with mice and other rodents!

</li><li> The commands <kbd>C-x 4 4</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 5 5</kbd> for displaying the results in a
new window/frame re gone.  We are quite certain that creating a new
window/frame before running a command is much simpler, and doesn&rsquo;t require a
complication of a new prefix.

</li><li> The behavior of active minibuffers when switching frames is now the perfect
mess it should be: sometimes the minibuffer moves to the new selected frame,
sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t, and sometimes you get an error.  This makes Emacs
usage much more fun, as you get to guess the result, instead of having it
boringly consistent.

</li><li> Compact mode-line display mode has been removed.  The items displayed on the
mode line are now always in the same place, and if there&rsquo;s not enough space
for them, they are not displayed at all, instead of being confusingly
displayed in a different position.  You no longer need to think twice where
to find a particular mode-line element on display.

</li><li> Many commands and options related to tab bars were removed, including (but
not limited to) frame-specific appearance of tab bars, the
<code>tab-bar-format</code> option, the <kbd>C-x t n</kbd>, <kbd>C-x t N</kbd>, <kbd>C-x t
M</kbd>, and <kbd>C-x t G</kbd> commands, and many mouse gestures on the tab bar.  We
are going to delete the tab bar support from Emacs in one of the past
versions, and this is a step in that direction.

</li><li> The &ldquo;transient&rdquo; input methods have been removed; use <kbd>C-\</kbd> to turn
input methods on and off instead.  This is in preparation for complete
removal of input methods from Emacs in version 19, and consistent with the
fact that the number of input methods we support becomes smaller as you move
back in time.

</li><li> We disabled <code>show-paren-mode</code> by default, since we think the venerable
<code>blink-matching-paren</code> feature is more than enough, and better fits the
simplicity of past Emacs versions.  It will definitely be better when colors
are removed from Emacs in the distant past.

<p>For the same reason, sub-groups in interactive regexp searches are no longer
highlighted in distinct colors.
</p>
</li><li> On our permanent quest for simplifying Emacs, we&rsquo;ve removed the Ispell
command <code>ispell-comment-or-string-at-point</code>; the old-time friend
<code>ispell-comments-and-strings</code> should suffice.

</li><li> Many Gnus commands and options were deemed to unnecessarily complicate the
use of Gnus (which is too complex to begin with), and thus were removed.
This includes <code>gnus-topic-display-predicate</code>,
<code>gnus-process-mark-toggle</code>, <code>gnus-registry-register-all</code>,
<code>gnus-paging-select-next</code>, and many others.  The <code>nnselect</code>
backend was deleted for the same reason.

</li><li> The <samp>project.el</samp> package have been redesigned to remove many
unnecessary features, so that just the bare essentials remain.  We plan on
removing this package from Emacs in a previous version, but decided to begin
with removing some extra features first.

</li><li> To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space, many
other functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 27.2.
</li></ul>
