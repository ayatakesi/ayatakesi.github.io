Each keyboard macro has an associated counter, which is initialized to 0 when you start defining the macro.  This <del>counter</del> <ins>@dfn{current counter}</ins> allows you to insert a number into the buffer that depends on the number of times the macro has been called.  The counter is <ins>normally</ins> incremented each time its value is inserted into the buffer.
