Once a package is downloaded and installed, it is <del>@dfn{loaded} into</del> <ins>made available to</ins> the current Emacs session.  <del>Loading a package is not quite the same as loading a Lisp library (@pxref{Lisp Libraries}); loading</del>  <ins>Making</ins> a package <ins>available</ins> adds its directory to @code{load-path} and loads its autoloads.  The effect of a package's autoloads varies from package to package.  Most packages just make some new commands available, while others have more wide-ranging effects on the Emacs session.  For such information, consult the package's help buffer.
