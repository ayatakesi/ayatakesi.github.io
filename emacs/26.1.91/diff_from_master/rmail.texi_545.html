The <del>commands @kbd{o} and @kbd{C-o} copy the current message into a specified file, adding it at the end.  The</del> two commands differ mainly in how much to copy: @kbd{o} copies the full message headers, even if they are not all visible, while @kbd{C-o} copies exactly the headers currently displayed and no more.  @xref{Rmail Display}.  In addition, @kbd{o} converts the message to Babyl format (used by Rmail in Emacs version 22 and before) if the file is in Babyl format; @kbd{C-o} cannot output to Babyl files at all.
