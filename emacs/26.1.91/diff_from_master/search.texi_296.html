<del>@kbd{C-M-w}</del><ins>@kbd{C-M-d}</ins> (@code{isearch-del-char}) deletes the last character from the search string, and @kbd{C-M-y} (@code{isearch-yank-char})  appends the character after point to the search string.  An alternative method to add the character after point is to enter the minibuffer with @kbd{M-e} (@pxref{Repeat Isearch}) and type @kbd{C-f} or @kbd{@key{RIGHT}} at the end of the search string in the minibuffer.  Each @kbd{C-f} or @kbd{@key{RIGHT}} you type adds another character following point to the search string.
