It is possible to get through all the files in the tags table with a single invocation of @kbd{M-x tags-query-replace}.  But often it is useful to exit temporarily, which you can do with any input event that has no special query replace meaning.  You can resume the query replace subsequently by typing @kbd{M-x <del>tags-loop-continue};</del> <ins>fileloop-continue};</ins> this command resumes the last tags search or replace command that you did.  For instance, to skip the rest of the current file, you can type @w{@kbd{M-> M-x <del>tags-loop-continue}}.</del> <ins>fileloop-continue}}.</ins>
