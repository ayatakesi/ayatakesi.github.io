When Emacs determines that it is time for auto-saving, it considers each buffer, and each is auto-saved if auto-saving is enabled for it and it has been changed since the last time it was auto-saved.  <del>The</del>  <ins>When the @code{auto-save-no-message} variable is set to @code{nil} (the default), the</ins> message @samp{Auto-saving...} is displayed in the echo area during auto-saving, if any files are actually <del>auto-saved.</del> <ins>auto-saved; to disable these messages, customize the variable to a non-@code{nil} value.</ins>  Errors occurring during auto-saving are caught so that they do not interfere with the execution of commands you have been typing.
