<del>@kbd{C-w} (@code{isearch-yank-word-or-char})</del><ins>@kbd{C-M-w} (@code{isearch-yank-symbol-or-char})</ins> appends the next character or <del>word</del> <ins>symbol</ins> at point to the search string.  This is an easy way to search for another occurrence of the <del>text</del> <ins>symbol</ins> at point.  (The decision of whether to copy a character or a <del>word</del> <ins>symbol</ins> is heuristic.)
