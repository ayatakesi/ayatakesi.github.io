Highlight text that matches @var{regexp} using face @var{face} (@code{highlight-regexp}).  The highlighting will remain as long as the buffer is loaded.  For example, to highlight all occurrences of the word ``whim'' using the default face (a yellow background), type @kbd{M-s h r whim @key{RET} @key{RET}}.  Any face can be used for highlighting, Hi Lock provides several of its own and these are pre-loaded into a list of default values.  While being prompted for a face use @kbd{M-n} and @kbd{M-p} to cycle through them.  <ins>A prefix numeric argument limits the highlighting to the corresponding subexpression.</ins>
