In the @file{*Occur*} buffer, you can click on each entry, or move point there and type @key{RET}, to visit the corresponding position in the buffer that was searched.  @kbd{o} and @kbd{C-o} display the match in another window; @kbd{C-o} does not select it.  Alternatively, you can use the <del>@kbd{C-x `}</del> <ins>@kbd{M-g M-n}</ins> (@code{next-error}) command to visit the occurrences one by one (@pxref{Compilation Mode}).
