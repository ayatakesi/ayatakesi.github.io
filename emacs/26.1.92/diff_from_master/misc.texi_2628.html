When Emacs starts in daemon mode, it cannot ask you any questions, so if it finds the desktop file locked, it will not load it, unless @code{desktop-load-locked-desktop} is @code{t}.  Note that restoring the desktop in daemon mode is somewhat problematic for other reasons: e.g., the daemon cannot use GUI features, so parameters such as frame position, size, and decorations cannot be restored.  For that reason, you may wish to delay restoring the desktop in daemon mode until the first client connects, by calling @code{desktop-read} in a hook function that you add to <del>@code{after-make-frame-functions}</del> <ins>@code{server-after-make-frame-hook}</ins> (@pxref{Creating Frames,,, elisp, The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual}).
