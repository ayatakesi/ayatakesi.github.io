To include a @samp{]} in a character set, you must make it the first character.  For example, @samp{[]a]} matches @samp{]} or @samp{a}.  To include a @samp{-}, write @samp{-} as the <del>first or</del> last character of the set, <del>or</del> <ins>tho you can also</ins> put it <ins>first or</ins> after a range.  Thus, @samp{[]-]} matches both @samp{]} and @samp{-}.
