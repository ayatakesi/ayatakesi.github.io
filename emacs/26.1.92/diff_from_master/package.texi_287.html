For finer control over <del>package loading,</del> <ins>which packages are made available at startup,</ins> you can use the variable @code{package-load-list}.  Its value should be a list.  A list element of the form <del>@code{(@var{name} @var{version})}</del> <ins>@w{@code{(@var{name} @var{version})}}</ins> tells Emacs to <del>load</del> <ins>make available</ins> version @var{version} of the package named @var{name}.  Here, @var{version} should be a version string (corresponding to a specific version of the package), or @code{t} (which means to <del>load</del> <ins>make available</ins> any installed version), or @code{nil} (which means no version; this disables the package, preventing it from being <del>loaded).</del> <ins>made available).</ins>  A list element can also be the symbol @code{all}, which means to <del>load</del> <ins>make available</ins> the latest installed version of any package not named by the other list elements.  The default value is just @code{'(all)}.
